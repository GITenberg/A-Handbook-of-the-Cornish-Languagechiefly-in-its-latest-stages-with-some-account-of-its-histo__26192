ix</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is principally intended for those persons of Cornish
nationality who wish to acquire some knowledge of their ancient
tongue, and to read, write, and perhaps even to speak it.&nbsp;
Its aim is to represent in an intelligible form the Cornish of
the later period, and since it is addressed to the general
Cornish public rather than to the skilled philologist, much has
been left unsaid that might have been of interest to the latter,
old-fashioned phonological and grammatical terms have been used,
a uniform system of spelling has been adopted, little notice has
been taken of casual variations, and the arguments upon which the
choice of forms has been based have not often been given.</p>
<p>The spelling has been adapted for the occasion.&nbsp; All
writers of Cornish used to spell according to their own taste and
fancy, and would sometimes represent the same word in different
ways even in the same page, though certain general principles
were observed in each period.&nbsp; There was a special
uncertainty about the vowels, which will be easily appreciated by
those who are familiar with Cornish English.&nbsp; Modern writers
of all languages prefer consistent spelling, and to modern
learners, whose object is linguistic rather than philological, a
fairly regular system of orthography is almost <!-- page x--><a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>a
necessity.&nbsp; The present system is not the phonetic ideal of
&ldquo;one sound to each symbol, and one symbol for each
sound,&rdquo; but it aims at being fairly consistent with itself,
not too difficult to understand, not too much encumbered with
diacritical signs, and not too startlingly different from the
spellings of earlier times, especially from that of Lhuyd, whose
system was constructed from living Cornish speakers.&nbsp; The
writer has arrived at his conclusions by a comparison of the
various existing spellings with one another, with the traditional
fragments collected and recorded by himself in 1875, with the
modern pronunciation of Cornish names, with the changes which
English has undergone in the mouths of the less educated of
Cornishmen, and to some extent with Breton.&nbsp; The author
suggests that this form of spelling should be generally adopted
by Cornish students of their old speech.&nbsp; The system cannot
in the nature of things be strictly accurate, but it is near
enough for practical purposes.&nbsp; Possibly there is much room
for controversy, especially as to such details as the
distribution of long and short vowels, the representation of the
Middle Cornish <i>u</i>, <i>ue</i>, <i>eu</i> sometimes by
<i>&icirc;</i>, sometimes by <i>&ecirc;</i>, and sometimes by
<i>eu</i> or <i>ew</i>, or of the Middle Cornish <i>y</i> by
<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>y</i>, or occasionally by an obscure
<i>&#259;</i>, <i>&#335;</i>, or <i>&#365;</i>, and it is quite
likely that others might arrive at different conclusions from the
same evidence, though those conclusions might not be any the
nearer to the sounds which the Cornishmen of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries really did make.&nbsp; As for grammatical
forms, it will be seen that the writer is of opinion that the
difference between Middle and Modern Cornish was more apparent
than real, and that except in the very <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>latest period
of all, when the language survived only in the mouths of the
least educated persons, the so-called &ldquo;corruptions&rdquo;
were to a great extent due to differences of spelling, to a want
of appreciation of almost inaudible final consonants, and to an
intensification of phonetic tendencies existing in germ at a much
earlier period.&nbsp; Thus it is that inflections which in the
late Cornish often seem to have been almost, if not quite,
inaudible, have been written in full, for that is the
author&rsquo;s notion, founded on what Middle Cornishmen actually
did write, of what Modern Cornishmen were trying to
express.&nbsp; For most things he has precedents, though he has
allowed himself a certain amount of conjecture at times, and in
most cases of difficulty he has trusted, as he would advise his
readers to do, to Breton rather than to Welsh, for the living
Breton of to-day is the nearest thing to Cornish that exists.</p>
<p>Why should Cornishmen learn Cornish?&nbsp; There is no money
in it, it serves no practical purpose, and the literature is
scanty and of no great originality or value.&nbsp; The question
is a fair one, the answer is simple.&nbsp; Because they are
Cornishmen.&nbsp; At the present day Cornwall, but for a few
survivals of Duchy jurisdictions, is legally and practically a
county of England, with a County Council, a County Police, and a
Lord-Lieutenant all complete, as if it were no better than a mere
Essex or Herts. <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; But every Cornishman knows well
enough, proud as he may be of belonging to the British Empire,
that he is no more an Englishman than a Caithness man is, that he
has as much right to a separate local patriotism to his <!-- page
xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>little Motherland, which rightly understood is no bar,
but rather an advantage to the greater British patriotism, <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a> as has a Scotsman, an Irishman, a
Welshman, or even a Colonial; and that he is as much a Celt and
as little of an &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon&rdquo; as any Gael, Cymro,
Manxman, or Breton.&nbsp; Language is less than ever a final test
of race.&nbsp; Most Cornishmen habitually speak English, and few,
very few, could hold five minutes&rsquo; conversation in the old
Celtic speech.&nbsp; Yet the memory of it lingers on, and no one
can talk about the country itself, and mention the places in it,
without using a wealth of true Cornish words.&nbsp; But a similar
thing may be said of a very large proportion of Welshmen,
Highlanders, Irishmen, Manxmen, and Bretons.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Omnia
Gr&aelig;ce</i>,<br />
<i>Quum sit turpe magis nostris nescire Latine</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why a Cornishman should learn Cornish, the outward
and audible sign of his separate nationality, is sentimental, and
not in the least practical, and if everything sentimental were
banished from it, the world would not be as pleasant a place as
it is.</p>
<p>Whether anything will come of the Cornish part of the Celtic
movement remains to be seen, but it is not without good omen that
this book is published at the &ldquo;Sign of the
Phoenix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few words of comprehensive apology for the shortcomings of
this handbook.&nbsp; When the writer was <!-- page xiii--><a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>asked by
the Secretary of the Celtic-Cornish Society to undertake a
Cornish grammar, which was the origin of this book, it was more
than twenty years since he had dropped his Cornish studies in
favour of other and more immediately necessary matters.&nbsp;
Much of what he once knew had been forgotten, and had to be
learnt over again, and the new grammar was wanted quickly.&nbsp;
There must needs be, therefore, inaccuracies and inconsistencies,
especially with regard to the spelling, which had to be
constructed, and he is conscious also that there are at least two
living men, if no more, who could have made a far better
book.&nbsp; Of either of these two, Dr. Whitley Stokes and Prof.
Joseph Loth, Doyen of the Faculty of Letters in Rennes
University, who probably know more about Cornish between them
than any one else ever did, the writer may well say, as John
Boson of Newlyn said of Keigwin two centuries ago,
&ldquo;<i>Markressa an dean deskez fear-na gwellaz hemma</i>,
<i>ev a venja kavaz fraga e owna en skreefa-composter</i>,
<i>etc.</i>&rdquo; <a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; For, indeed, even in that same
<i>skreefa-composter</i> is there much scope for argument, and
Boson&rsquo;s &ldquo;et cetera&rdquo; stands for a good deal
besides.</p>
<p>It is not given to a grammar-writer to strive after
originality.&nbsp; If he did so, he would probably not be the
better grammarian.&nbsp; The writer therefore has no hesitation
in acknowledging to the full his many obligations to previous
workers on the subject.&nbsp; To Lhuyd and Pryce, to Gwavas,
Tonkin, Boson, and Borlase he owes much (and also,
parenthetically, he thanks Mr. John Enys of Enys for lending him
the Borlase MS.).&nbsp; But <!-- page xiv--><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>it is to
the workers of the second half of the nineteenth century, living
or departed, that he owes most, and especially to Dr. Edwin
Norris, Dr. Whitley Stokes, Prof. Loth, Canon Robert Williams,
and Dr. Jago.&nbsp; Of the works of these writers he has made
ample use, though he has not necessarily agreed with them in
every detail.</p>
<p>The well-known work of Edwin Norris has been of the greatest
value in every way, and the copious examples given in his
&ldquo;Sketch of Cornish Grammar&rdquo; have frequently saved the
writer the trouble of searching for examples himself.&nbsp; Dr.
Whitley Stokes&rsquo;s editions of two dramas and a poem have
been of the greatest assistance, the notes to the <i>St.
Meriasek</i> being especially valuable in collecting and
comparing the various forms of irregular verbs, etc.&nbsp;
Without Canon Williams&rsquo;s Lexicon nothing could have been
done, and though some amount of friendly criticism and correction
has been given to it by Dr. Stokes and Prof. Loth, neither of
whom, of course, really undervalues the Lexicon in the least, no
one can fail to appreciate that excellent work.&nbsp; Prof.
Loth&rsquo;s articles are mostly on details.&nbsp; A more general
work from his hand is much to be desired, and every Cornish
student must look forward to the forthcoming volume of his
<i>Chrestomathie Bretonne</i>, which will contain the Cornish
section.&nbsp; It would have been better for the present work if
its author could have seen that volume before writing this.&nbsp;
But Prof. Loth&rsquo;s articles in the <i>Revue Celtique</i> have
been full of suggestions of the greatest value.&nbsp; Dr.
Jago&rsquo;s English-Cornish Dictionary has also been most
useful.&nbsp; In a somewhat uncritical fashion, he has collected
together all the various forms and spellings of each word that he
could find, and this <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>rendered it possible to make easily
comparisons which would otherwise have given a good deal of
trouble.&nbsp; Even the somewhat unconventional lexicographical
arrangement of the book has had its uses, but, if one may venture
an adverse criticism, it was a pity to have followed Borlase in
including without notice so many Welsh and Breton words for which
there is no authority in Cornish.&nbsp; It is on this account
that the work needs to be used with caution, and may at times
mislead the unwary.</p>
<p>The author begs to thank very heartily Mr. E. Whitfield Crofts
(&ldquo;Peter Penn&rdquo; of the <i>Cornish Telegraph</i>) for
his great service in making this handbook known among
Cornishmen.</p>
<p>Perhaps a subject in connection with Cornish which may be of
greater general interest than anything else is the interpretation
of Cornish names.&nbsp; It is for this reason that a chapter
embodying shortly some general principles of such a study has
been added, and for those who would try their hands at original
verse composition in Cornish a chapter on the principles of
Cornish prosody has also been given.&nbsp; The composition of
twentieth-century Cornish verse has already begun.&nbsp; Dr. C.
A. Picquenard of Quimper, well known as a Breton poet under the
title of <i>Ar Barz Melen</i>, has produced several excellent
specimens, Mr. L. C. R. Duncombe-Jewell published the first
Cornish sonnet in <i>Celtia</i> in 1901, and the present writer
has contributed a sonnet and translations of the Trelawny Song
and the National Anthem to the <i>Cornish Telegraph</i>, besides
writing two Christmas Carols, one in <i>Celtia</i> and one
printed separately, and the dedication of this book, which, he
may <!-- page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>remark, is not meant for a sonnet,
though it happens to run to fourteen lines.</p>
<p>The writer had originally intended to add some reading
lessons, exercises, and vocabularies, but it was found that the
inclusion of these would make the book too large.&nbsp; He hopes
to bring out shortly a quite small separate book of this
character, which may also include conversations, and he has in
preparation a complete vocabulary, though he has no idea as to
when it will be finished.</p>

LITERATURE</h2>
<h3><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE STORY OF THE CORNISH LANGUAGE</h3>
<p>There have been seven Celtic languages&mdash;not all at once,
of course&mdash;and indeed it is possible that there may have
been more; but seven are known to have existed.&nbsp; One other
may have been a Celtic speech, or it may have been something
pre-Celtic, but of it we know too little to judge.</p>
<p>The Celtic languages belong to the type known as Aryan or
Indo-European, the language of the higher or white races whose
original habitat was once taken to have been near or among the
Himalayas, but is now located with much less exactness than
heretofore.&nbsp; To this class belong the Sanscrit, with its
multitude of Indian derivatives; the Persian, ancient and modern;
the Greek, the Latin with all its descendants, the Lithuanian,
the Slavonic, the Teutonic and Scandinavian, the Albanian and the
Celtic.&nbsp; It is not to be supposed that the possession of an
Aryan language is necessarily a proof of the possession of Aryan
blood.&nbsp; In many cases the conquering white race imposed its
language on the aborigines whom it subjugated and enslaved.&nbsp;
This must have been very much the case in Britain, and it is
probable that the lower classes of a great part of England,
though they now speak a language of mixed Teutonic and Latin
origin, as they once spoke Celtic, are largely the descendants,
through the slaves successively of Britons, Romans, and Saxons,
and the &ldquo;villains&rdquo; or <i>nativi</i> of the Norman
manorial system, of the aboriginal pal&aelig;olithic
&ldquo;cave&rdquo; man, and have far less in common <!-- page
4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>with the
Anglo-Saxon, the Celt, or any other white man than they have with
the Hottentot, the Esquimaux, the Lapp, or the Australian
&ldquo;blackfellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is particularly the case in
what was once the forest-covered district of middle
England.&nbsp; There, no doubt, when there was any fighting to be
done, the aboriginal hid in the woods until it was all over, and
only then came out to share in the spoil and the glory and the
drinks; while the white man, whether Briton, Saxon, or Norman,
went out to fight, and not infrequently to be killed.&nbsp; A
survival, perhaps, of the unfittest was the result, which may
account for some of the peculiar characteristics of the Midland
lower classes.&nbsp; That the successive changes of masters were
matters of little or no importance to the enslaved aboriginal,
while a life of servitude was intolerable to the free white man,
may account for the fact that the labouring classes of Devon,
Cornwall, Somerset, Wales, and the Welsh border are of a type
infinitely superior in manners, morals, and physique to the same
class in the Midlands, because they now consist almost entirely
of the descendants of the free Britons who were driven westward
rather than submit to the overwhelming invasion of the Teutonic
tribes.&nbsp; Thus it is that probably, except for a certain
Silurian (or Iberian) element in South Wales, which descends from
the higher or fighting sort of pre-Aryan, and a surviving
aboriginal element in parts of Ireland, the natives of what are
known as the &ldquo;Celtic&rdquo; parts of these islands are more
purely Aryan than any except the upper and upper middle classes
of the so-called &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon&rdquo; districts of
Britain.&nbsp; And of the Celtic parts of Britain, the
Highlanders of Scotland and the Cornish are probably of the most
unmixed Aryan or white race.</p>
<p>The Celtic languages are subdivided into two branches,
representing two separate immigrations, about <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>which little is
known for certain, except that they happened a very long time
ago.&nbsp; These are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Goidelic (or Gaelic), consisting of the three
languages, or properly the three dialects, known as the Gaelic of
Ireland, of the Scottish Highlands, and of the Isle of Man.&nbsp;
It has been said, with some truth, that these three are as far
apart as three dialects of the same language can well be, but are
not sufficiently far apart to be counted as three distinct
languages.&nbsp; Until the first half of the eighteenth century
the written Gaelic of the Scottish Highlands differed from that
of Ireland scarcely more than the written English of London
differs from that of New York.&nbsp; Even now, though the use of
the sixth and seventh century Latin minuscules, which people
choose to call &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; letters, has been dropped in
Scotland, any one who can read the one dialect will have little
difficulty in reading the other.&nbsp; Manx adopted in the
seventeenth century an attempted, but not very successful,
phonetic spelling, based partly on Welsh and partly on English,
and therefore looks on paper very different from its sister
languages; but it takes a Gaelic-speaking Highlander of
intelligence a very short time to get to understand spoken Manx,
though spoken Irish (except the Ulster dialect) is more difficult
to him.&nbsp; Possibly Pictish, if it was Celtic at all, which is
uncertain, was of the Gaelic branch, for we find but little of
any language difficulty when St. Columba and his
fellow-missionaries, whose own speech certainly was Gaelic, were
evangelising among the Picts.&nbsp; But the absence of such
mention proves very little, for Christian missionaries, from
Pentecost onwards, have not infrequently made light of the
linguistic barrier, and we really know next to nothing about
Pictish.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Brythonic (or British), consisting of Welsh, <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Cornish, and Breton.&nbsp; These may be said to be as
near together as three separate languages can well be, but to
have drifted too far apart to be accounted three dialects of the
same language.&nbsp; The place of Cornish, linguistically as well
as geographically, is between Welsh and Breton, but though in
some points in which Welsh differs from Breton, Cornish resembles
the former, on the whole it approaches more nearly to the
latter.&nbsp; Probably Cornish and Breton are both derived from
the language of the more southern, while Welsh represents that of
the more northern Britons. <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Of course
Cornish, like Welsh, has been influenced to some extent by
English, while the foreign influence on Breton has been
French.&nbsp; It is probable that the ancient Gaulish, certainly
a Celtic language, belongs to this branch.</p>
<p>The seven Celtic languages, then, are Irish, Albanic (or
Scottish), and Manx Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and Gaulish,
and it is possible that Pictish must be added to these.</p>
<p>Though a philologist has much to say on the points of
resemblance between the Goidelic and Brythonic branches, and
though no one who studies both can fail to be struck by their
affinity in vocabulary, in grammar, and even in idiom, the
speakers of different branches&mdash;a Welshman and a Highlander,
for instance&mdash;are no more mutually intelligible than an
Englishman and a German would be, if as much so.&nbsp; The three
sets of Gaels, however, can understand one another with
considerable difficulty, and Irish priests have been known to
preach sermons (with but moderate success) in the Catholic parts
of the Highlands.&nbsp; But though there has <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>been for some
time a Welsh mission of some sort of Nonconformists in Brittany
(with doubtless a very limited following), it is said that the
missionaries, though they learnt Breton easily, were greatly
disappointed with the extent to which at first they could
understand the Bretons or make themselves understood.&nbsp;
Simple things of everyday life might be asked for in Welsh, and a
Breton might &ldquo;average&rdquo; what was said, but no sort of
conversation could be held, though any one who knew both Welsh
and Breton might make himself understood at some length by a
mixed audience, if he very carefully picked his phrases; it would
not, however, be good Welsh or good Breton.&nbsp; But the same
would only apply in a far less degree to Cornish, for Cornish is
very much nearer to Breton than Welsh is. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; The divergence is increased by the
tendency of all the Celtic languages, or, indeed, of all
languages, to subdivide into local dialects.&nbsp; Thus the Irish
of Munster, of Connaught, and of Ulster must be mutually
intelligible only with great difficulty; the dialect of Munster,
by reason of the difference of the stress accent, being
especially divergent.&nbsp; There is growing up now, with the
Irish revival, what may be called a Leinster dialect, founded on
the literary language, with peculiarities of its own.&nbsp; The
Scottish Gaelic has at least four marked dialects: Northern,
spoken in Sutherland, part of Caithness, and Ross; Western,
spoken in Inverness-shire and Argyle and in the Islands; and the
rather broken-down dialects of Arran and of Perthshire, but the
speakers of these are not very unintelligible to one
another.&nbsp; Even Manx has a tendency to a &ldquo;north
side&rdquo; and a &ldquo;south side&rdquo; dialect.&nbsp; Welsh
has two fairly well marked dialects, of North Wales and South
Wales, <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>and the Welsh of Glamorgan, once the classical form of
the language, before the Cardiganshire Welsh of the translation
of the Bible superseded it, is now tending to be a broken-down
form of South Welsh.&nbsp; But all these spoken dialects of Welsh
are kept together and their tendency to divergence is greatly
checked by the existence of a very clearly defined spelling,
grammar, and standard of style in the book language of what is
far and away the most cultivated and literary of all the Celtic
tongues.&nbsp; Breton has four well-defined dialects, those of
Leon, Treguier, Cornouailles, and Vannes, besides the broken-down
Breton of the Croisic district, the Vannes dialect differing from
the others as much as Cornish does, and curiously resembling
Cornish in some of its peculiarities.&nbsp; Here there is no one
literary standard, but each of the four dialects has its own,
though it is generally held, rightly or wrongly, that the Leonais
dialect is the best, and the Vannetais the worst.&nbsp; An
examination of the names of places in West Cornwall gives some
indication that there was a slight difference of dialect between
the Hundred of Kerrier, or perhaps one should rather say the
peninsula of Meneage, and the Hundred of Penwith, but it amounted
to very little, and the evidence is very scanty.</p>
<p>The difference between Cornish and its two sisters is not very
easy to define in a few words.&nbsp; There are differences of
phonology, vocabulary, and grammatical forms.&nbsp; In phonology
the most marked difference from both is the substitution of
<i>s</i> or <i>z</i>, with a tendency, intensified in later
Cornish, to the sound of <i>j</i> or <i>ch</i>, for <i>d</i> or
<i>t</i> of Welsh and Breton.&nbsp; Cornish agrees with Breton in
not prefixing a vowel (<i>y</i> in Welsh) to words beginning with
<i>s</i> followed by a consonant, and its vowel sounds are
generally simpler and less diphthongalised than those of
Welsh.&nbsp; It agrees with Welsh in changing what one may call
the French <i>u</i> sound into <i>&icirc;</i> (English
<i>ee</i>), going <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>apparently further than Welsh in that
direction, while Breton still retains the <i>u</i>.&nbsp; Like
Welsh, it retained the <i>th</i> and <i>dh</i> sounds which
Breton, in nearly all its dialects, has changed into <i>z</i>,
though these in Cornish, like the guttural <i>gh</i>, and
<i>v</i> or <i>f</i>, showed a tendency to drop off and become
silent, especially as finals.&nbsp; In vocabulary Cornish follows
Breton more closely than Welsh, though there are cases where in
its choice of words it agrees with the latter, and cases in which
it is curiously impartial.&nbsp; An instance of the last is the
common adjective <i>good</i>.&nbsp; The ordinary Welsh word is
<i>da</i>, though <i>mad</i> (Gaelic <i>math</i>) does
exist.&nbsp; In Breton <i>mad</i> is the regular word, though
<i>da</i> is used as a noun in the sense of <i>satisfaction</i>
or <i>contentment</i> (<i>da eo gant-han</i>, good is with him=he
is pleased).&nbsp; In Cornish <i>da</i> and <i>mas</i> are used
about equally.&nbsp; As an instance of the first, <i>bras</i>,
which in Welsh means <i>fat</i>, <i>gross</i>, is the more common
Cornish and Breton word for <i>large</i> or <i>great</i>, though
<i>m&ecirc;r</i> (<i>mur</i>, <i>meur</i>) in Cornish, and
<i>meur</i> in Breton, the equivalents of the Welsh <i>mawr</i>,
are also used.&nbsp; In grammatical forms Cornish almost
invariably in cases where Welsh and Breton differ follows the
latter, but, as in vocabulary, it sometimes has also ways of its
own.</p>

<p>Except for the existence of Cornish names in the Bodmin
Gospels, and in Domesday Book and one or two early charters, and
of the Cornish vocabulary in the Cottonian Library, the earliest
mention of the Cornish as differentiated from any other British
language that has been as yet discovered occurs in Cott. MS.
Vesp. A. xiv., in the British Museum (the volume in which the
said vocabulary is included), in a Latin life of St. Cadoc.&nbsp;
This speaks of St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount being called, &ldquo;in
the idiom of that province,&rdquo; <i>Dinsol</i> (or the Mount of
the Sun).</p>
<p>Giraldus Cambrensis, writing in the latter part of the <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>In the fifteenth-century cartulary of Glasney College,
belonging to Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh of Menabilly, an old prophecy
is quoted: &ldquo;<i>In Polsethow ywhylyr anethow</i>, <i>in
Polsethow habitaciones seu mirabilia videbuntur</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is supposed to date before the foundation of the college in
1265.</p>
<p>In a letter of 1328-9 from John de Grandisson, Bishop of
Exeter, 1327-1369, to Pope John XXII., the writer speaks of
Cornwall as looking on the south upon Vasconia [Gascony] and
Minor Britannia [Brittany] <a name="citation10b"></a><a
href="#footnote10b" class="citation">[10b]</a>; &ldquo;Cujus
lingua ipsi utuntur Cornubici.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in another letter
in the same year to certain cardinals he says: &ldquo;Lingua,
eciam, in extremis Cornubie non Anglicis set Britonibus extat
nota.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this comes another passage in the
Register of Bishop Grandisson, quoted by Dr. Oliver in his
<i>Monasticon Di&aelig;cesis Exoniensis</i> (p. 11), which, in an
account of the submission of the parish of St. Buryan to the
bishop, after a certain quarrel between them, states that a
formal submission was made by the principal parishioners in
French and English (the names are given, thirteen in number), and
by the rest in Cornish, interpreted by Henry Marseley, the rector
of St. Just, and that after this the bishop preached a sermon,
which was interpreted by the same priest for the benefit of those
members of the congregation who could only speak Cornish.&nbsp;
These records are to be found in Mr. Hingeston Randolph&rsquo;s
edition of the Grandisson <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Registers,
and in these and other fourteenth-century Exeter registers there
are several allusions to the obligations of hearing confessions
and propounding the Word of God in Cornish.</p>
<p>But until the time of Henry VIII. we have no trustworthy
information about the state or extent of the language.&nbsp; It
is highly probable, from the number of places still retaining
undoubtedly Celtic names, and retaining them in an undoubtedly
Cornish form, that until at least the fifteenth century the Tamar
was the general boundary of English and Cornish; though there is
said to be some evidence that even as late as the reign of
Elizabeth, Cornish was spoken in a few places to the east of the
Tamar, notably in the South Hams.&nbsp; Polwhele, however, limits
the South Hams use of Cornish to the time of Edward I., and we
know from the English Chronicle that when Athelstan drove the
&ldquo;Welsh&rdquo; out of Exeter in 936, he set the Tamar for
their boundary.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII. we have an
account given by Andrew Borde in his <i>Boke of the Introduction
of Knowledge</i>, written in 1542.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;In
Cornwall is two speches, the one is naughty Englysshe, and the
other is Cornysshe speche.&nbsp; And there be many men and women
the which cannot speake one worde of Englysshe, but all
Cornyshe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then gives the Cornish numerals and a
few sentences of ordinary conversation.&nbsp; These are much
mixed with English, and were, no doubt, such as might have been
heard on the borders of Devon, for he probably did not penetrate
very far, being doubtless deterred by the impossibility of
obtaining drinkable beer&mdash;a circumstance which seems to have
much exercised his mind in describing Cornwall.&nbsp; These
numerals and sentences are, as far as is known, the earliest
specimens of printed Cornish, earlier by a hundred and sixty-five
years than Lhuyd&rsquo;s Grammar, though Dr. Jago, <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>quoting from Drew and Hutchins, who had evidently never
seen this book, Dr. Davies&rsquo;s <i>Llyfr y Resolusion</i> of
1632, or Gibson&rsquo;s edition of Camden&rsquo;s
<i>Britannia</i> of 1695, says that there is no evidence that
anything was ever printed in Cornish before Lhuyd.</p>
<p>The Reformation did much to kill Cornish.&nbsp; Had the Book
of Common Prayer been translated into Cornish and used in that
tongue, two things might have happened which did not&mdash;the
whole language might have been preserved to us, and the Cornish
as a body might have been of the Church of England, instead of
remaining (more or less) of the old religion until the perhaps
unavoidable neglect of its authorities caused them to drift into
the outward irreligion from which John Wesley rescued them. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; But it is said by Scawen and by
Bishop Gibson in his continuation of Camden&rsquo;s
<i>Britannia</i>, that they <i>desired</i> that the Prayer-book
might not be translated, and, though the statement is disputed,
it is quite possible that the upper classes, who spoke English,
did make some such representation, and that the bulk of the
population in Cornwall, as elsewhere, had no wish for the
Reformed Service-book in any language; for there were churches in
Cornwall in which the old Mass according to the Use of Salisbury
was celebrated as late as the seventeenth century, notably in the
Arundel Chapel in St. Columb Church, as may clearly be inferred
from the inscription on the tomb of John Arundel and his wife,
the latter of whom died in 1602.</p>
<p>It is asserted by Carew, Polwhele, Davies Gilbert, Borlase,
and others, that in the time of Henry VIII. Dr. John Moreman, the
parson of Menheniot, was the first to teach his parishioners the
Creed, Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and Commandments in English, these
having been <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>&ldquo;used in Cornish beyond all
remembrance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This same Dr. Moreman is mentioned in
the petition (or rather <i>demand</i>) presented to Edward VI. by
the Cornwall and Devon insurgents, in favour of the old form of
worship.&nbsp; One paragraph of this is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;We will not receive the new service,
because it is but like a Christmas game.&nbsp; We will have our
old service of Matins, Mass, Evensong, and Procession as it was
before; and we the Cornish, <i>whereof certain of us understand
no English</i>, do utterly refuse the new service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early part of the reign of Elizabeth, during the course
of the many discussions on church matters, a number of articles
were drawn up, to judge by their general tone, by the extreme
Protestant party, and a copy of these, taken from a MS. in Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge, occurs in Egerton MS. 2350, f. 54, in
the British Museum.&nbsp; They are entitled &ldquo;Articles drawn
out by some certaine, and were exhibited to be admitted by
authority, but not so admitted,&rdquo; and their date, to judge
by accompanying letters, etc., is about 1560.&nbsp; The last
article is &ldquo;A punishment for such as cannot say the
Catechisme,&rdquo; and in it there occurs the following sentence:
&ldquo;Item that it may be lawfull for such Welch or Cornish
children as can speake no English to learne the Pr&aelig;mises in
the Welch tongue or Cornish language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same reign, but somewhat later, a report on England,
addressed to Philip II. of Spain by an Italian agent, speaks thus
of Cornwall: &ldquo;Li hauitanti sono del tutto differenti <i>di
parlare</i>, di costume et di leggi alli Inglesi; usano le leggi
imperiali cosi como fa ancola li Walsche loro vicini; quali sono
in prospettiva alli Irlanda et sono similmente tenuti la maggior
parte Cattolici.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, since the agent insists
that the Severn divides Cornwall from England, he can hardly have
known much about the country.&nbsp; The report occurs <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>among
a number of Spanish state papers in Add. MS. 28,420, in the
British Museum.</p>
<p>In Carew&rsquo;s <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, written about
1600, we read, however, that the language had been driven into
the uttermost parts of the Duchy, and that very few were ignorant
of English, though many affected to know only their own
tongue.&nbsp; It seems, however, from what he says further on,
that the <i>guaries</i>, or miracle plays, were then commonly
acted in Cornish, and that the people flocked to them in large
numbers, and evidently understood them.&nbsp; Carew adds that the
principal love and knowledge of the language died with one
&ldquo;Dr. Kennall, the civilian,&rdquo; probably John Kennall,
D.C.L., Archdeacon of Oxford.&nbsp; Carew gives the numerals and
a few other specimens of the language.</p>
<p>In a survey of Cornwall, by John Norden, entitled <i>Speculum
Magn&aelig; Britanni&aelig;</i>, <i>pars Cornwall</i>, addressed
to James I., the following account of the language is given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cornish people for the moste parte are descended of
British stocke, though muche mixed since with the Saxon and
Norman bloude, but untill of late years retayned the British
speache uncorrupted as theirs of Wales is.&nbsp; For the South
Wales man understandeth not perfectly the North Wales man, and
the North Wales man little of the Cornish, but the South Wales
man much.&nbsp; The pronunciation of the tongue differs in all,
but the Cornish is far the easier to be pronounced.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he goes on to compare the sound of it with the Welsh, to the
disadvantage of the latter. . . . &ldquo;But of late the
Cornishmen have much conformed themselves to the use of the
English tongue, and their English is equal to the best,
especially in the Eastern partes; even from Truro eastward is in
a manner wholly Englishe.&nbsp; In the west parte of the county,
as in the Hundreds of Penwith and Kerrier, the Cornishe tongue is
mostly in use, and yet it is to be marvelled that <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>though husband and wife, parents and children, master
and servauntes, doe mutually communicate in their native
language, yet there is none of them but in manner is able to
converse with a stranger in the English tongue, unless it be some
obscure persons that seldom converse with the better
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1630 Sir John Dodridge in his <i>History of the Ancient and
Modern estate of the Principality of Wales</i>, <i>Duchy of
Cornwall</i>, <i>and Earldom of Chester</i>, says: &ldquo;The
people inhabiting the same [<i>i.e.</i> Cornwall] are
call&rsquo;d Cornishmen, and are also reputed a remanent of the
Britaines . . . they have a particular language called Cornish
(although now much worn out of use), differing but little from
the Welsh and the language of the Britaines of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1632, Dr. John Davies, the well-known Welsh lexicographer,
published a Welsh translation of the <i>Booke of Christian
Exercise</i> of Robert Parsons the Jesuit, under the title of
<i>Llyfr y Resolusion</i>.&nbsp; In it he gives a Cornish version
of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Creed, the earliest extant, and
evidently translated from Latin, not from English.</p>
<p>In the same year appeared a play called <i>The Northern
Lass</i>, by Richard Brome.&nbsp; In this occurs an opprobrious
sentence of Cornish, put into the mouth of a Cornishman bearing
the absurd name of &ldquo;Nonsence,&rdquo; and addressed to a
Spaniard who had no English, on the argument that Cornwall being
the nearest point of Britain to Spain, Cornish might possibly
approach nearer to Spanish than English did.</p>
<p>The next mention of Cornish we find in a diary of the Civil
War, written by Richard Symonds, one of the Royalist army in
Cornwall in 1644 (Brit. Mus., Add. MS. 17,052).&nbsp; He gives a
short vocabulary of common words, together with four short
sentences.&nbsp; To these he appends the following
note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>&ldquo;The language is spoken
altogether at Goonhilly, and about Pendennis and the Land&rsquo;s
End they speak no English.&nbsp; All beyond Truro they speak the
Cornish language.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much about the same time William Jackman, the vicar of St.
Feock, near Falmouth, chaplain of Pendennis Castle during its
siege by the rebel troops, was in the habit of using Cornish for
the words of administration of Holy Communion, because the old
people did not understand English.&nbsp; The Cornish words
asserted to have been used by him were printed in Hals&rsquo;s
History of Cornwall in 1750, though they do not occur in all
copies of that scarce book.</p>
<p>In 1662 and 1667 John Ray, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, mentions
one Dickon Gwyn (his real name was Dick Angwin), of St. Just, as
the only man who could write Cornish.&nbsp; Ray adds that few of
the children could speak it, &ldquo;so that the language is like
in a short time to be quite lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is probably the &ldquo;Sieur Angwin&rdquo; mentioned in a
valuable little treatise on the Cornish language by John Boson of
Newlyn, of which more later.&nbsp; This little tract, entitled
<i>Nebbaz Gerriau dro tho Carnoack</i> (or &ldquo;A few words
about Cornish&rdquo;), is only known from a copy which formerly
belonged to the late Mr. W. C. Borlase.&nbsp; It was written
about the year 1700, and according to it the Cornish-speaking
district was then &ldquo;from the Land&rsquo;s End to the Mount
and towards St. Ives and Redruth, and again from the Lizard to
Helston and towards Falmouth,&rdquo; but the language had
decreased very much within the writer&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Dr. Borlase that Cheston Marchant, who died
at Gwithian in 1676 aged 164 (!), could speak nothing but
Cornish.</p>
<p>Writing in the latter part of the reign of Charles II.,
William Scawen, a Cornish antiquary, gives a long <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>account of the state of the language in his time, in a
treatise in which he laments the decline thereof, accounting for
it by no less than sixteen elaborate reasons.&nbsp; This
treatise, <i>Antiquities Cornu-Britannick</i>, was abridged by
Thomas Tonkin, the Cornish historian, and the abridgment was
printed in 1777, and again by Davies Gilbert at the end of his
history.&nbsp; A copy of the full form of it in Tonkin&rsquo;s
beautiful handwriting, a much more elaborate work, is in Add. MS.
33,420 in the British Museum.&nbsp; According to this, the
inhabitants of the western promontories of Meneage and Penwith
were in the habit of speaking the language, so much so that the
parson of Landewednack, Mr. Francis Robinson, used to preach in
Cornish down to the year 1678, that being the only tongue well
understood by his parishioners.&nbsp; Scawen mentions the MSS. of
the aforesaid &ldquo;Anguin,&rdquo; as he spells him, and laments
their destruction.&nbsp; He also speaks of a &ldquo;Matins&rdquo;
(possibly a Primer, or Hours of our Lady) in Cornish, which had
belonged to &ldquo;Mr. Maynard.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>In Bishop Gibson&rsquo;s edition of Camden&rsquo;s
<i>Britannia</i>, published in 1695, there is a short account of
the Cornish Language, and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Creed, the
same versions as those given by Scawen, are given as
specimens.&nbsp; According to Gibson the language was confined to
two or three western parishes, and was likely to last a very
little longer.&nbsp; He mentions the <i>Poem of the Passion</i>,
the <i>Ordinalia</i>, and the <i>Creation</i> as the only books
existing in the language.</p>
<p>The next authority is that excellent Celtic scholar, Dr.
Edward Lhuyd, who published his <i>Arch&aelig;ologia
Britannica</i> in the year 1707.&nbsp; He gives the following
list of the parishes in which the language was spoken:&mdash;St.
Just, Paul, Buryan, Sennen, St. Levan, Morva, Sancreed, <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Madron, Zennor, Towednack, St. Ives, Lelant, Ludgvan,
and Gulval, and along the coast from the Land&rsquo;s End to St.
Keverne (this would also include St. Hillary, Perran Uthno,
Breage, Germoe, Mullion, Gunwalloe, Ruan Major and Minor,
Landewednack, Grade, and St. Keverne), adding that many of the
inhabitants of these parishes, especially the gentry, do not
understand it, &ldquo;there being no need, as every Cornishman
speaks English.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a letter of Lhuyd&rsquo;s
to Henry Rowlands, author of <i>Mono Antiqua Restaurata</i>
(1723), printed at the end of that work, in which similar
information, dated 1701, is given.&nbsp; Lhuyd in this letter
relates his adventures in Brittany, and remarks on the closeness
of Cornish to Breton.</p>
<p>Then the language quickly receded, until, in 1735, there were
left only a few people at Mousehole, Paul, Newlyn, St. Just, and
other parishes along the coast between Penzance and the
Land&rsquo;s End who understood it.&nbsp; It was about this time
that Gwavas and Tonkin finished their collections on the subject,
and the language they found seemed to them a most irregular
jargon&mdash;a peculiarity of which was a striking uncertainty of
the speakers as to where one word left off and another began.</p>
<p>In the early part of the eighteenth century there was a little
coterie of antiquaries at Penzance and the neighbourhood, who had
busied themselves much with the remains of the old
language.&nbsp; The patriarch of these was old John Keigwin of
Mousehole, the translator of the <i>Poem of the Passion</i> and
the play of <i>The Creation</i>.&nbsp; He was born in 1641, and
died in 1710, and, according to Lhuyd and Borlase, his knowledge
of Cornish was &ldquo;profound and complete.&rdquo;&nbsp;
However, that did not prevent him from making some extraordinary
mistakes in his translations, which should perhaps be set down to
the archaic form of the language with which he had <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to
deal.&nbsp; He seems to have been a considerable if rather
pedantic linguist, being accredited with an acquaintance with
Latin, Greek, French, and even Hebrew, and in a translation into
Cornish of the letter of King Charles to the people of Cornwall,
he made use of his Hebrew knowledge when he failed to remember
the exact Cornish word, writing &ldquo;milcamath&rdquo; for
&ldquo;war.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the other members of this little
party may be mentioned William Gwavas, John Boson and his brother
Thomas, Thomas Tonkin the historian, Oliver Pender, and last (as
probably the youngest) Dr. William Borlase, the author of the
well-known History of Cornwall.&nbsp; It does not seem that any
of these, except Keigwin, troubled themselves much about Cornish
literature, but they did good service in the way of preserving
words, proverbs, colloquial sentences, etc., and seem to have
found great enjoyment in translating various passages of
Scripture, songs, etc., into the Cornish that was current in
their own day.&nbsp; These being spelt more or less phonetically
(as far as the writers knew how to do so), and therefore varying
a good deal in orthography, are now of great value in determining
the sound of the latest Cornish.</p>
<p>When Lhuyd was at work upon his Cornish Grammar, he received
considerable assistance from Keigwin, Gwavas, and Tonkin, and a
vocabulary and collection of Cornish fragments compiled by the
last two under the title of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia
Cornu-Britannica</i> were afterwards printed by Dr. William Pryce
in 1790, with Lhuyd&rsquo;s Grammar, <i>under his own name</i>,
with the same title. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; This fraud, if
it really deserves so harsh a name, was exposed by Prince L. L.
Bonaparte, into whose hands the original MS. of some of it fell;
but though it certainly was not right of Pryce to act in this
manner, he <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>does deserve some credit for having
published the vocabulary at all, and the service that he did in
so doing may be the better estimated by a knowledge of the fact
that it was very considerably through the medium of Pryce&rsquo;s
publication that Dr. Edwin Norris obtained the acquaintance with
Cornish necessary to enable him to bring out his valuable edition
of the early Cornish dramas.&nbsp; It is strange that so much
abuse has been heaped upon Pryce, while Davies Gilbert has
escaped with comparative freedom, in spite of a villainously
careless edition of a number of scraps of Cornish (printed at the
end of his edition of the play of <i>The Creation</i>), gathered
entirely from Tonkin&rsquo;s MS., the Gwavas MS., or the Borlase
MS., and inserted, with notes and all, without a word of
acknowledgment, and in such a manner as to lead one to think that
the translation and notes at any rate were his own doing.&nbsp;
Pryce certainly took the trouble to correct his proofs, and
Davies Gilbert could hardly have attempted to do so.&nbsp;
Moreover, if Pryce&rsquo;s preface be read carefully, it will be
seen that he by no means claims the whole credit for himself, but
gives plenty of it, though perhaps not enough, to Gwavas, Tonkin,
Lhuyd, and Borlase.&nbsp; The impression left by the preface is
that Pryce was a more or less intelligent editor who added a
little of his own, the amount of which he exaggerated.</p>
<p>In 1746 Captain (afterwards Admiral) the Hon. Samuel
Barrington, brother of Daines Barrington the antiquary, took a
sailor from Mount&rsquo;s Bay, who spoke Cornish, to the opposite
coast of Brittany, and found him fairly able to make himself
understood.&nbsp; In 1768 Daines Barrington himself writes an
account of an interview with the celebrated Mrs. Dolly Pentreath,
popularly, but erroneously, supposed to have been the last person
who spoke the language.&nbsp; He also contributed to
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, in 1779, a letter received in <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>1776,
written in Cornish and English, from William Bodenor, a fisherman
of Mousehole, who according to Polwhele died in 1794.&nbsp; The
writer states that not more than four or five people in his town,
and these old folk of eighty years of age, could speak
Cornish.&nbsp; But Barrington says that he received information
that John Nancarrow of Market-Jew, aged only forty in 1779, could
speak it.&nbsp; Dolly Pentreath died in 1777; but Pryce, in the
preface to his book of 1790, part of which is his own, though one
knows not how much of it to believe, and Whitaker, vicar of
Ruan-Lanihorne, in his Supplement to Polwhele&rsquo;s <i>History
of Cornwall</i> (1799), mention that two or three people were
still living who were able to speak Cornish, though this was only
hearsay evidence.</p>
<p>In his <i>History of Cornwall</i>, vol. v. (1806), the Rev. R.
Polwhele speaks of one Tompson, an engineer of Truro, whom he met
in 1789, the author of the well-known epitaph on Dolly Pentreath,
and says that he knew more Cornish than ever Dolly Pentreath
did.&nbsp; But Polwhele did not think that at the time he wrote
there were two persons living who could really converse in
Cornish for any length of time.&nbsp; Some years ago the present
writer came upon a letter in the British Museum addressed to Sir
Joseph Banks, and dated 1791, the author of which mentions his
own father as the only living man who could speak Cornish.&nbsp;
Unluckily the reference to the letter has been lost, and there is
so much Banks correspondence in the British Museum that it is
almost impossible to find it again.&nbsp; But the statement is by
no means conclusive, and there were probably several other
&ldquo;last living men&rdquo; going on at once, and certainly
John Tremethack, who died in 1852 at the age of eighty-seven,
must have known a good deal of Cornish, some words of which he
taught to his daughter, Mrs. Kelynack of Newlyn, who was living
in 1875.&nbsp; There <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>was also George Badcock, the
grandfather of Bernard Victor of Mousehole, who taught a certain
amount of Cornish to his grandson, who was living in 1875, when
the present writer saw him.</p>
<p>Then it is considered that Cornish, as a spoken language, died
out.&nbsp; The process was gradual, though perhaps rather rapid
at the last, and, as far as is generally known, the old tongue
finally disappeared in the earlier half of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; Words and sentences, and even such things as the
Creed and Lord&rsquo;s Prayer were handed on, some of them to our
own day.&nbsp; The mother-in-law of the present writer, Mrs. W.
J. Rawlings (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hambly) of Hayle, who died in 1879
at the age of fifty-seven, had learnt to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer and Creed in Cornish when she was a child at school at
Penzance, but unluckily had quite forgotten them in later
life.&nbsp; In 1875 Mr. and Mrs. John Kelynack, Mrs. Soady, Mrs.
Tregarthen, and Captain Stephen Richards, all of Newlyn, and Mr.
Bernard Victor of Mousehole handed on to the Rev. W. S. Lach
Szyrma, then vicar of Newlyn, and to the present writer the
tradition of the numerals and a few words and sentences, which
may be found in a paper contributed by the present writer to the
<i>Transactions of the Philological Society</i> in 1876, and a
few years later Dr. Jago received some of the same
tradition.&nbsp; Thus it may be said that so long as any of these
three are alive, a faint flicker of living Cornish remains, even
if there is no verity in the weird legends of the survival of
more as an esoteric language among the peasantry and the mining
and fishing folk of the West.&nbsp; But even if the spoken
Cornish be dead, its ghost still haunts its old dwelling, for the
modern English speech of West Cornwall is full of Celtic words,
and nine-tenths of the places and people from the Tamar to the
Land&rsquo;s End bear Cornish names.</p>

23</span>Mr. Hobson Matthews in his <i>History of St. Ives</i>,
<i>Lelant</i>, <i>Towednack</i>, <i>and Zennor</i>, has an
interesting chapter on Cornish.&nbsp; He gives reasons for
supposing that the language survived in St. Ives, Zennor, and
Towednack even longer than in Mounts Bay, and states that the
families of Stevens and Trewhella were among the last to keep it
up in Towednack.&nbsp; He also mentions one John Davy, who was
living in 1890 at Boswednack in Zennor (a hamlet between the
Gurnard&rsquo;s Head and Zennor Churchtown), who had some
traditional knowledge of Cornish, knew the meanings of the
place-names in the neighbourhood, and &ldquo;could converse on a
few simple topics in the ancient language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unless
Mr. Matthews, whose judgment one would trust in such a matter,
actually heard him do so, the last statement is not easy to
believe.</p>

24</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE LITERATURE AND OTHER REMAINS OF
CORNISH</h3>
<p>The following is a list, in order of date, of the known
remains of Cornish from the earliest times to the end of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; There may be others of very early date,
which have been hitherto classified as old Welsh or Breton, such
as the Lament for Geraint, King of Devon, generally attributed to
Llywarch Hen, and certain glosses in Latin MSS.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>The Manumissions in the Bodmin Gospels</i> (Add.
MS. 9381, in the British Museum).&nbsp; The MS. is of the tenth
century, and belonged to St. Petrock&rsquo;s Priory of Black
Canons, originally Benedictine, at Bodmin.&nbsp; At the beginning
and end are manumissions of serfs from whose names about two
hundred Cornish words may be gathered.&nbsp; These have been
printed in the <i>Revue Celtique</i> (vol. i. p. 332), with notes
by Dr. Whitley Stokes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>The Cottonian Vocabulary</i> (Cott. MS. Vesp. A.
xiv., in the British Museum).&nbsp; This forms part of a MS. of
the end of the twelfth century, and consists of about seven
pages, preceded by a calendar containing many Celtic names, and
followed by lives of Welsh and Cornish saints.&nbsp; The words
are classified under various headings such as heaven and earth,
different parts of the human body, birds, beasts, fishes, trees,
herbs, ecclesiastical and liturgical terms, and at the end occur
a number of adjectives.&nbsp; It has been printed by Zeuss in his
<i>Grammatica Celtica</i>, by Dr. Norris with the
<i>Ordinalia</i>, and has been incorporated into Canon
Williams&rsquo;s Cornish Lexicon.&nbsp; <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Many of the
words in it were incorporated by Dr. John Davies in his Welsh
Dictionary, as coming from what he calls the <i>Liber
Landavensis</i>, and a quotation from the Life of St. Cadoc in
the same MS. is spoken of in Camden&rsquo;s <i>Britannia</i> as
coming from the Book of Llandaff.&nbsp; The MS. evidently bore
that name for a time.&nbsp; It is probable, from certain mistakes
in it, that the vocabulary is a copy of an earlier one, in which
the letters <i>&#503;</i> and &thorn; of the Saxon alphabet were
used.</p>
<p>Of about the same date as this manuscript was a composition in
Cornish, of which the original is lost, except a few words.&nbsp;
This was a <i>Prophecy of Merlin</i>, which only exists in a
translation into Latin hexameters by John of Cornwall, who in his
notes gives a few words of the original, which are certainly
Cornish.&nbsp; Like many of the so-called Merlin prophecies, this
relates to the struggle between Stephen and the Empress Matilda,
but it contains local Cornish allusions of great interest.&nbsp;
The only known MS. is one of the fourteenth century, in the
Vatican.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The single sentence, <i>In Polsethow ywhylyr
anetkow</i>, in the Cartulary of Glasney College.&nbsp; If the
writer of the history of the foundation of the college is
correct, this prophecy, &ldquo;In Polsethow [the Pool of Arrows,
the old name of Glasney] shall be seen habitations,&rdquo; is
older than the foundation in 1265.&nbsp; It is therefore the
oldest known complete sentence of Cornish, and is interesting as
containing the inflected passive <i>whylyr</i>.&nbsp; There is an
abstract of the cartulary, by Mr. J. A. C. Vincent, in the 1879
volume of the <i>Journal of the Royal Institution of
Cornwall</i>, and this sentence is given there, with an
explanatory note by the late Mr. W. C. Borlase.&nbsp; The
original belongs to Mr. Jonathan Rashleigh of Menabilly.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; On the back of a charter in the British Museum (Add.
Charter 19,491) the present writer discovered in 1877 a fragment
of forty-one lines of Cornish verse.&nbsp; <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>The writing
was very faint, indeed the MS. had passed through other and by no
means incompetent hands without this precious endorsement being
noticed, and the finder might have missed it too had he not been
deliberately looking for possible Cornish words on the backs of a
number of charters relating to St. Stephen-in-Brannel, after he
had finished the necessary revision of the cataloguing of these
documents.&nbsp; The date of the document is 1340, but the
Cornish writing on the back is somewhat later, perhaps about
1400.&nbsp; The language and spelling agree with those of the
<i>Poem of the Passion</i> and the <i>Ordinalia</i>, and the
exact metre is not found anywhere else.&nbsp; The speaker (it may
be a part in some play) offers a lady to some other person as a
wife, praises her virtues, and then gives the lady some rather
amusing advice as to her behaviour to her future husband, and how
to acquire the position attributed in Cornish folklore to the
influence of the Well of St. Keyne and St. Michael&rsquo;s
Chair.&nbsp; A copy of these verses was printed in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in 1877, but, as the writer admits, his
readings were not at all good, for the writing was very
faint.&nbsp; Dr. Whitley Stokes, who had the advantage of working
on a photograph, which brought out many letters which were
invisible in the original, published an amended version in the
<i>Revue Celtique</i>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>The Poem of Mount Calvary</i>, or <i>The
Passion</i>.&mdash;There are five MSS. of this in
existence.&nbsp; One is in the British Museum (Harl. 1782), and
is probably the original, said to have been found in the church
of Sancreed.&nbsp; It is a small quarto, on rough vellum, written
very badly in a mid-fifteenth-century hand, and embellished with
very rude pictures.&nbsp; Of the other copies, two are in the
Bodleian, an incomplete and much &ldquo;amended&rdquo; one in the
Gwavas collection of Cornish writings in the British Museum, with
an illiterate translation by William Hals, the Cornish historian,
and one is in private hands.&nbsp; <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>It has been
twice printed, once with a translation by John Keigwin of
Mousehole, edited by Davies Gilbert in 1826, and by Dr. Whitley
Stokes for the Philological Society in 1862.&nbsp; There is very
little in this poem beyond a versified narrative of the events of
the Passion, from Palm Sunday to Easter morning, taken directly
from the four Gospels, with some legendary additions from the
Gospel of Nicodemus and elsewhere, preceded by an account of our
Lord&rsquo;s fasting and temptation.&nbsp; The metre consists of
eight-lined stanzas (written as four lines) of seven-syllabled
lines.&nbsp; There are two hundred and fifty-nine of these
stanzas.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>The Ordinalia</i>.&mdash;These consist of three
dramas collectively known under this title.&nbsp; The first play,
called <i>Origo Mundi</i>, begins with the Creation of the World,
the Fall of Man, Cain and Abel, etc.; this being followed by the
building of the Ark and the Flood, the story of the temptation of
Abraham closing the first act.&nbsp; The second act gives us the
history of Moses, and the third represents the story of David and
of the building of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, curiously ending with
a description of the martyrdom of St. Maximilla as a Christian
(!) by the bishop placed in charge of the temple by
Solomon.&nbsp; The second play, <i>Passio Domini</i>, represents
the Temptation of Christ, and the events from the entry into
Jerusalem to the Crucifixion; and this goes on without
interruption into the third play, <i>Resurrectio Domini</i>,
which gives an account of the Harrowing of Hell, the
Resurrection, and the Ascension, with the Legend of St. Veronica
and Tiberius, and the death of Pilate.&nbsp; As in the <i>Poem of
the Passion</i>, the pseudo-Gospel of Nicodemus and other
legendary sources are drawn upon.</p>
<p>But running through the whole and interwoven with the
Scriptural narrative comes the beautiful and curious Legend of
the Cross.&nbsp; The legend, most of which is in the dramas, is
this.&nbsp; When Adam found himself dying, he <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>sent his son
Seth to the Gates of Paradise to beg of the angel that guarded
them the oil of mercy, that his father might live.&nbsp; The
angel let him look into Paradise, where he saw many strange and
beautiful foreshadowings of things that should be upon the earth;
and the angel gave him three seeds from the Tree of Life, and he
departed.&nbsp; When he came to where his father was, he found
that he was already dead, and he laid the three seeds in his
mouth, and buried him therewith on Mount Moriah; and in process
of time the three seeds grew into three small trees, and Abraham
took of the wood thereof for the sacrifice of Isaac his son; and
afterwards Moses&rsquo; rod, wherewith he smote the rock, was
made from one of their branches.&nbsp; And soon the three trees
grew together into one tree, whereby was symbolised the mystery
of the Trinity; and under its branches sat King David when Nathan
the Prophet came to him, and there he bewailed his sin, and made
the Miserere Psalm.&nbsp; And Solomon, when he would build the
Temple on Mount Sion, cut down the tree, which was then as one of
the chiefest of the cedars of Lebanon, and bid men make a beam
thereof; but it would in no wise fit into its place, howsoever
much they cut it to its shape.&nbsp; Therefore Solomon was wroth,
and bid them cast it over the brook Cedron as a bridge, so that
all might tread upon it that went that way.&nbsp; But after a
while he buried it, and over where it lay there came the Pool
Bethesda with its healing powers; and when our Lord came on earth
the beam floated up to the surface of the pool, and the Jews
found it, and made thereof the Cross whereon Christ died on
Calvary.</p>
<p>The metres of these plays are various arrangements of seven
and four-syllabled lines, of which more anon in the chapter on
prosody.&nbsp; There are three MSS. of this Trilogy in existence,
1. The Oxford MS. of the fifteenth <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>century, from
which the others were copied, and from which Dr. Edwin Norris
edited the plays in 1859.&nbsp; 2. Another Oxford MS., presented
to the Bodleian by Edwin Ley of Bosahan about 1859, with a
translation by John Keigwin.&nbsp; The copy of the text is older
by a century than the translation.&nbsp; 3. A copy in the library
of Sir John Williams, Bart., of Llanstephan, Carmarthenshire,
with an autograph translation by Keigwin.&nbsp; This was
Lhuyd&rsquo;s copy.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>The Life of St. Meriasek</i>.&mdash;This play, the
MS. of which was written by &ldquo;Dominus Hadton&rdquo; in the
year 1504, as appears by the colophon, was discovered by Dr.
Whitley Stokes some thirty-two years ago among the MSS. of the
Peniarth Library, near Towyn in Merioneth.&nbsp; It represents
the life and death of Meriasek, called in Breton Meriadec, the
son of a Duke of Brittany, and interwoven with it is the legend
of St. Sylvester the Pope and the Emperor Constantine, quite
regardless of the circumstance that St. Sylvester lived in the
fourth century, and St. Meriasek in the seventh.&nbsp; The play
contains several references to Camborne, of which St. Meriasek
was patron, and to the Well of St. Meriasek there.&nbsp; It is
probable that it was written for performance at that town.&nbsp;
The language of the play is later than that of the
<i>Ordinalia</i>, the admixture of English being greater, while a
few of the literal changes, such as the more frequent
substitution of <i>g</i> (soft) for <i>s</i>, and in one instance
(<i>bednath</i> for <i>bennath</i>) the change of <i>nn to
dn</i>, begin to appear.&nbsp; The grammar has not changed much,
but the use of the compound and impersonal forms is more
frequent, and the verb <i>menny</i> has begun to be more commonly
used as a simple future auxiliary.&nbsp; The metres are much the
same as those of the <i>Ordinalia</i>.&nbsp; The spelling is
rather more grotesque and varied.&nbsp; But, since this play (or
combination of plays) is to a large extent on <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>local Cornish
and Breton, rather than on conventional Scriptural lines, it has
an interest, full of mad anachronisms as it is, which is not to
be found in the Biblical plays.&nbsp; Some passages are of
considerable literary merit, and a good deal of early Cornish and
Breton history is jumbled up in it, and yet remains to be worked
out, for Dr. Whitley Stokes&rsquo;s excellent edition of 1872
does not go very much into historical side questions.&nbsp; It is
unlucky that this play was not discovered until after the
publication of Canon Williams&rsquo;s Lexicon, but his own
interleaved copy of the Lexicon, with words and quotations from
<i>St. Meriasek</i>, is in the possession of Mr. Quaritch of
Piccadilly, and Dr. Stokes has published forty pages of new words
and forms from the same play in <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Celtische
Lexicographie</i>.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The Cornish conversations in Andrew Borde&rsquo;s
<i>Booke of the Introduction of Knowledge</i>, printed in
1542.&mdash;These consist of the numerals and twenty-four
sentences useful to travellers.&nbsp; They were evidently taken
down by ear, and appear in a corrupted form.&nbsp; Restored
texts, agreeing in almost every detail, were published by Dr.
Whitley Stokes in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, vol. iv., and by
Prof. Loth in the <i>Archiv fur Celtische Lexicographie</i> in
1898.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; In Carew&rsquo;s <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, 1602, are
the numerals up to twenty, with a hundred, a thousand, and what
is meant for ten thousand, but is really something else.&nbsp;
There are also ten words compared with Greek, a dozen phrases,
some more words, and the Cornish equivalents of twelve common
Christian names.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <i>The Creation of the World</i>, <i>with
Noah&rsquo;s Flood</i>, by William Jordan of Helston, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1611.&nbsp; The construction of this
play is very like that of the first act of the <i>Origo Mundi</i>
(the metres are substantially the same), <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and the
author has borrowed whole passages from it; but as a whole
Jordan&rsquo;s play possesses greater literary merit, and there
are many additions to the story in it, and much amplification of
the ideas and dialogue.&nbsp; Occasionally sentences of several
lines in English are introduced, and it is curious to note that
whenever this is the case, they are given to Lucifer or one of
his angels, and in such a manner as to seem as if the author
meant to imply that English was the natural language of such
beings, and that they only spoke Cornish when on their good
behaviour, relapsing into their own tongue whenever they became
more than ordinarily excited or vicious.&nbsp; Five complete
copies of this play are known, two of which are in the Bodleian,
one in the British Museum (Harl. MS. 1867), and two are in
private hands (one bound up with the MS. of <i>The Passion</i>
already mentioned).&nbsp; Besides these there is a fragment in a
similar hand to that of the complete Museum copy (certainly not
that of John Keigwin, who translated the play in 1693 at the
request of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then Bishop of Exeter, though
it has his translation on the opposite pages to the text) in the
Gwavas collection in the British Museum.&nbsp; In a list of books
published in <i>Welsh</i> (as it is expressed), given in one of
Bagford&rsquo;s collections for a History of Printing (Lansdowne
MS. 808, in the British Museum), mention is made of this
play.&nbsp; No date is given, but the names of the books are
arranged chronologically, and this comes between one of 1642 and
one of 1662.&nbsp; The play has been printed (with
Keigwin&rsquo;s translation) by Davies Gilbert in 1827, and with
a translation by Dr. Whitley Stokes in the Philological
Society&rsquo;s volume for 1864.&nbsp; Of William Jordan, the
writer, nothing is known whatever.&nbsp; He may have been merely
the transcriber, and it is possible that the transcription may be
connected <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>with that revival of Cornish
patriotism which seems to have happened in the early seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; <i>Nebbaz Gerriau dro tho Carnoack</i> (A few words
about Cornish), by John Boson of Newlyn.&nbsp; The only known MS.
of this little tract in Cornish and English was formerly among
the MSS. of Dr. William Borlase in the possession of his
descendant, Mr. W. C. Borlase.&nbsp; The present writer had it in
his possession for a short time in 1877 or 1878, and copied about
half of it, but returned it to Mr. Borlase, who wanted it back,
and it was then printed in the 1879 volume of the <i>Journal of
the Royal Institution of Cornwall</i>.&nbsp; At the time of the
sale of Mr. Borlase&rsquo;s library, this tract, which when the
present writer last saw it used to live between the pages of Dr.
Borlase&rsquo;s MS. Collections on Cornish, did not appear, and
its present ownership is unknown.&nbsp; It is in the handwriting
of the Rev. Henry Usticke, Vicar of Breage (died 1769), and in
the Gwavas MS. in the British Museum there are several pieces in
the same hand.&nbsp; As a copy of Boson&rsquo;s original it is
rather inaccurate, but Boson wrote by no means a clear
hand.&nbsp; It is of great interest as the composition of one
who, though he was brought up to speak English, as he himself
says, had acquired a thorough knowledge of Cornish as it was
spoken in his day, without having even looked at any of the
literary remains of the language.&nbsp; He was also a man of
general education, and in this tract and in his letters is rather
fond of airing his Latin.&nbsp; Very little is known of him
except that he was the son of Nicholas Boson and was born at
Newlyn in 1655 and died some time between 1720, the date of his
last letter to Gwavas, and 1741, the date of the death of the
latter, who is recorded to have received a copy of verses in
Cornish found among Boson&rsquo;s papers after his death.&nbsp;
The date of the <i>Nebbaz Gerriau</i> is <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>unknown, but
it mentions a little book called <i>The Duchess of
Cornwall&rsquo;s Progress</i>, which the author says that he
wrote &ldquo;some years past&rdquo; for his children, refers
(though not by name) to John Keigwin, who died in 1710, as being
still alive, and does not mention Lhuyd&rsquo;s Grammar,
published in 1707, so that we may infer that the date is
somewhere about 1700.&nbsp; <i>The Duchess of Cornwall&rsquo;s
Progress</i>, which had at least thirty pages (for he refers to
the thirtieth page), was probably in English, with a few passages
in Cornish, which Dr. Borlase, who had seen two copies of it,
transcribed into his Cornish Collections.&nbsp; Judging from his
letters and from this tract, John Boson was a man of considerable
intelligence, and one about whom one would like to know more, and
his Cornish writings are of more value than those of the somewhat
pedantic Keigwin.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; <i>The Story of John of Chy-an-Hur</i>.&mdash;This
is a popular tale of some length, of a labouring man who lived at
Chy-an-Hur, or the Ram&rsquo;s House, in St. Levan, and went east
seeking work, and of what befell him.&nbsp; It is the <i>Tale of
the Three Advices</i>, found in many forms.&nbsp; It appears
first in Lhuyd&rsquo;s Grammar, printed in 1707, where it has a
Welsh translation.&nbsp; Lhuyd says that it &ldquo;was written
about forty years since,&rdquo; which dates it <i>circ.</i>
1667.&nbsp; Part of it, undated, but in the hand of John Boson,
occurs with an English translation in the Gwavas MS. (Brit. Mus.,
Add. MS. 28,554).&nbsp; This, as appears by a note on the back of
the first leaf, was written out for Gwavas&rsquo;s instruction in
Cornish.&nbsp; The spelling is altogether different from
Lhuyd&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Another copy in Cornish of Lhuyd&rsquo;s
spelling, with an English translation, is in the Borlase MS.,
copied from the lost MS. of Thomas Tonkin, with some corrections
by Dr. Borlase.&nbsp; It was printed with Lhuyd&rsquo;s Welsh and
an <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>English version, in Pryce&rsquo;s <i>Arch&aelig;ologia
Cornu-Britannica</i> in 1790, and by Davies Gilbert at the end of
his edition of Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>, 1827, in Cornish
and English.&nbsp; The English versions of Borlase, Pryce, and
Davies Gilbert are substantially the same, and are probably
Tonkin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An English version, translated from
Lhuyd&rsquo;s Welsh, but pretended to be from Cornish, was
printed in <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in 1818, and again
in an abridged and expurgated form in Mr. J. Jacob&rsquo;s
collection of Celtic Fairy Tales in 1891.&nbsp; There is a much
amplified version of the story in English in William
Botterell&rsquo;s <i>Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West
Cornwall</i>, published at Penzance in 1870, and a short and
rather foolish one in Hunt&rsquo;s <i>Popular Romances of the
West of England</i>, 1865, 1871, 1881.&nbsp; The language is a
good specimen of the latest Cornish.&nbsp; The same story is
given as an Irish folk-tale in an early volume of
<i>Chambers&rsquo;s Journal</i>.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; The Preface to the Cornish Grammar in Lhuyd&rsquo;s
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica</i>.&nbsp; This consists of two
and a quarter folio pages of close print, and is written in the
Cornish of his own day.&nbsp; It is the work of a foreigner, but
is nevertheless very well done.&nbsp; A not very good
translation, probably the work of Tonkin and Gwavas, is given by
Pryce, and reprinted by Polwhele in the fifth volume of his
History.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; The rest of the remains of Cornish consist of a few
songs, verses, proverbs, epigrams, epitaphs, maxims, letters,
conversations, mottoes, and translations of chapters and passages
of Scripture, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Creed, the Ten
Commandments, King Charles&rsquo;s Letter, etc.&nbsp; They are
found in the Gwavas MS. (Brit. Mus., Add. MS. 28,554), a
collection made by William Gwavas, barrister-at-law, and ranging
in date from 1709 to 1736; in the Borlase MS. of the date of
about 1750, in the handwriting of Dr. <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>William
Borlase, Rector of Ludgvan, formerly in the possession of his
descendant, the late W. C. Borlase, F.S.A., M.P., but now
belonging to Mr. J. D. Enys, of Enys; in Pryce&rsquo;s
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cornu-Britannica</i>, 1790, and in Davies
Gilbert&rsquo;s editions of the <i>Poem of the Passion</i> and
Jordan&rsquo;s play of <i>The Creation</i>, published
respectively in 1826 and 1827.&nbsp; Those in the Borlase MS.
(except a few from a work of John Boson), and those printed by
Pryce and Davies Gilbert, were probably taken from the Gwavas MS.
and from Tonkin&rsquo;s MSS.&nbsp; There is also one epitaph
dated 1709 in Paul Church, an epitaph on Dolly Pentreath, which
does not appear ever to have been inscribed on her tomb, and the
letter of William Bodenor in 1776.</p>
<p>These fragments may be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>
<h4>Songs and Poems<span class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; Lhuyd&rsquo;s Elegy on William of Orange, 1702.&nbsp;
Sixty-three lines of verse in rhyming triplets, in modern
Cornish, with occasional archaic turns.&nbsp; A copy occurs in
the Gwavas MS.; it was printed by Pryce, with a Latin version, as
part of a correspondence between Lhuyd and Tonkin, and by
Polwhele in his fifth volume, with the same correspondence.&nbsp;
There is a copy with an English version by John Keigwin in the
library of Sir John Williams, Bart., of Llanstephan.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A song beginning &ldquo;<i>Ma leeas gwreage</i>,
<i>lacka vel zeage</i>,&rdquo; a series of moral platitudes on
married life and the bringing up of children, by James Jenkins of
Alverton, near Penzance (died 1710).&nbsp; This consists of five
stanzas of five or six lines each.&nbsp; There is a complete copy
in the Gwavas MS., and a copy wanting one line in the Borlase
MS., and this in complete version, with a translation, has been
printed by Pryce and Davies Gilbert.&nbsp; A note in Pryce says
that Tonkin had it from Lhuyd and <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>again from
Gwavas, whose is the translation.&nbsp; It is in idiomatic late
Cornish, in rather wild spelling.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Song on James II. and William of Orange, by John
Tonkin of St. Just, a tailor, who appears to have been a solitary
Whig in a nation of Jacobites, as with very few exceptions the
Cornish certainly were.&nbsp; It begins, &ldquo;<i>Menja tiz
Kernuak buz galowas</i>,&rdquo; and consists of fourteen
four-lined stanzas of modern Cornish, probably composed in 1695,
to judge by the historical allusions.&nbsp; It is in the Gwavas
MS. only, and has never been printed.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A song of moral advice by the same writer, beginning
&ldquo;<i>Ni venja pea a munna seer</i>,&rdquo; and consisting of
seven four-lined stanzas, only one of which, beginning
&ldquo;<i>An Prounter ni ez en Plew East</i>,&rdquo; has been
printed (from the Borlase MS.) in the <i>Journal of the Royal
Institution of Cornwall</i> for 1866.&nbsp; The complete song is
in the Gwavas MS., and has never been published.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; A song beginning &ldquo;<i>Pelea era why moaz</i>,
<i>moz</i>, <i>fettow</i>, <i>teag</i>&rdquo; (Where are you
going, fair maid? he said).&nbsp; This consists of six four-lined
stanzas, the second and fourth lines of each stanza being the
burthen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Gen agaz bedgeth gwin</i> (or according
to Borlase, Tonkin, and Gwavas, <i>pedn du</i>) <i>ha agaz blew
mellyn</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>(With your white face, or black head, and your yellow
hair)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Rag delkiow sevi gwra muzi
teag</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>(For strawberry leaves make maidens fair).</p>

<p>The song was sung by one Edward Chirgwin or Chygwin,
&ldquo;brother-in-law to Mr. John Groze of Penzance, at Carclew,
in 1698,&rdquo; as a note by T. <!-- page 37--><a

says.&nbsp; Whether it was translated from English or whether the
Cornish is the original does not appear.&nbsp; The story is not
quite the same (or quite so scrupulously &ldquo;proper&rdquo;) as
the English nursery version.&nbsp; There is a copy in the
handwriting of Chirgwin in the Gwavas MS., and one copied from
Tonkin&rsquo;s MS. in the Borlase MS.&nbsp; It was printed by
Pryce in an amended form, and by Polwhele.</p>

with boat and net), and describing the process of bringing the
fish ashore and putting them into bulks and making
&ldquo;fairmaids&rdquo; of them.&nbsp; There is a copy with a
translation in the Borlase MS., which was printed in the

<p>3.&nbsp; A considerable number of similar phrases scattered
throughout Borlase&rsquo;s Cornish Vocabulary at the end of his
History of Cornwall.&nbsp; These are to be found, evidently
copied from the Vocabulary, in a manuscript which belonged in
1777 to Henry Brush of Carnaquidn Stamps (on the road from
Penzance to Zennor), which place belonged to William Veale of
Trevaylor, who married the daughter of Gwavas.&nbsp; The MS. is

Borlase&rsquo;s <i>Antiquities Historical and Monumental of
Cornwall</i> in 1754, and again, revised, in 1769.&nbsp; It is a
copious vocabulary, but is rendered rather less valuable by the
inclusion of a large number of Welsh and Breton words, gathered
chiefly from other parts <!-- page 46--><a

Supplementary Cornish Glossary (<i>Transactions of the

Jago&rsquo;s English-Cornish Dictionary, they have not been
thoroughly exhausted yet, and a good many more words may be
collected from them, as also from the attempted interpretations
of place-names in Pryce&rsquo;s book and in the Gwavas MS.</p>

47</span>PART II&mdash;THE GRAMMAR OF THE CORNISH LANGUAGE</h2>
<h3><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>
<p>The Cornish language divides very naturally into three
periods, (1) Ancient, (2) Middle, (3) Modern.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Ancient period is only represented by the
Cottonian Vocabulary, which, though a MS. of the twelfth century,
is probably a copy of a much earlier one, by perhaps a few
glosses, and by the names in the Bodmin Gospels.&nbsp; It has no
extant literature.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Middle period is that of the Add. Charter
fragment, the <i>Ordinalia</i>, the <i>Poem of the Passion</i>
(fifteenth century), the <i>Life of St. Meriasek</i> (1504), and
to some extent of the play of <i>The Creation</i> (1611), though
the last is partly transitional.&nbsp; Judging from the few words
preserved in John of Cornwall&rsquo;s twelfth-century translation
of a prophecy of Merlin, the lost original of that was perhaps in
an early form of Middle Cornish.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Modern period begins with the few sentences in
Andrew Borde&rsquo;s book (1542), and continues to the end.</p>
<p>As the whole of the extant literature of Middle Cornish is in
verse, it gives us little help as regards the colloquial Cornish
even of its own period, and judging from Andrew Borde&rsquo;s
sentences, only some forty years later than the <i>St.
Meriasek</i> and seventy years earlier than Jordan&rsquo;s play,
Middle and Modern Cornish must have overlapped one another a good
deal.&nbsp; It is probable that those who wrote verse would
continue to use archaic forms long after they had been dropped in
prose and in conversation.&nbsp; But the difference <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>between Middle and Modern Cornish is not really very
great, and comes to very little more than a difference of
spelling, an uncertainty about the final letters of certain
words, and a tendency to contractions, elisions, and apocopations
in words, which, though recognised in their fuller form in the
spelling of Middle Cornish verse, may have been nearly as much
contracted, elided, and apocopated in Middle Cornish
conversation.&nbsp; Dr. Whitley Stokes points out in his edition
of Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i> certain changes, and though the
language of that play is substantially Middle Cornish, the
spelling is largely of the pre-Lhuydian popular Modern Cornish
sort.&nbsp; Among these changes are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; The final <i>e</i> becomes
<i>a</i>.&nbsp; [This is perhaps only a question of spelling, and
need not imply a difference of sound.&nbsp; Probably a sound as
of the German final <i>e</i> is intended. <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>]</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; <i>th</i> and <i>gh</i> have become
mute, and are often interchanged.&nbsp; [In Modern Cornish
<i>th</i> is often omitted, or represented by <i>h</i>.]</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, become
respectively <i>bm</i>, <i>dn</i>.&nbsp; [Probably the sounds
existed long before they were recognised in spelling.]</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; <i>s</i> becomes frequently a soft
<i>g</i> (<i>j</i>).&nbsp; [This <i>j</i> sound also may have
existed long before it was written as a <i>g</i> or
<i>j</i>.&nbsp; The <i>s</i> of the earlier MSS. was probably
never intended to represent in these cases a true <i>s</i>.&nbsp;
Dr. Stokes might also have mentioned the similar cases of
<i>she</i> being used where the older MSS. write <i>sy</i> for
the second person singular.]</p>
<p>The apparent changes of vowel sounds in the still later
Cornish, more fully discussed further on, are mostly these:</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; <i>a</i> long sometimes becomes
<i>aw</i>, especially before <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span><i>l</i>,
<i>n</i>, or <i>r</i>, and occasionally as a final; <i>a</i>
short, under similar circumstances, becomes <i>o</i> short.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; <i>u</i>, with (approximately) the
French sound of that letter, becomes <i>ee</i> (<i>&icirc;</i>),
or else <i>ew</i>, as in the English word <i>dew</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; <i>eu</i>, <i>ue</i>, with the
French sound of <i>eu</i>, or the German <i>o</i>, becomes
<i>&ecirc;</i> (=<i>ay</i> in <i>may</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; <i>y</i> of Middle Cornish, perhaps
pronounced as <i>&#301;</i>, but sometimes obscurely, like the
primary sound of the Welsh <i>y</i>, often became short
<i>e</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; An open long <i>y</i>, which may
have been sounded <i>ee</i> (<i>&icirc;</i>) in Middle Cornish,
often later became <i>ei</i> (or as <i>i</i> in <i>mine</i>),
though there are inconsistencies in this respect, showing that
the change was not universal.</p>
<p class="gutindent">6.&nbsp; In a considerable number of cases
short <i>o</i> became the &ldquo;obscure vowel,&rdquo; <i>o</i>
of <i>London</i> or <i>u</i> of <i>until</i>.</p>
<p>It does not follow that these were very distinct changes
between Middle and Modern Cornish.&nbsp; Possibly the change in
sound was a good deal less than on paper, and consisted in
intensifying earlier changes.&nbsp; The Middle Cornish system of
spelling looks very like an inheritance from an earlier time
still.</p>
<p>The grammatical changes were few, and, except for a
diminishing use of pronominal suffixes, those, like the new
preterite of <i>gw&icirc;l</i>, to do, were chiefly false
analogies, or else imitations of English.&nbsp; But it is to be
remembered that a great proportion of the remains of Modern
Cornish consists of translations and a few original compositions
by persons whose own language was English, who had in some cases
learnt Cornish very imperfectly.&nbsp; This would apply to most
of the translations of passages of Scripture, to Lhuyd&rsquo;s
Preface (though, of course, <i>his</i> own language was Welsh),
and to Gwavas&rsquo;s attempts.&nbsp; The really valuable
specimens <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>are the writings of Boson,
Bodenor&rsquo;s Letter to Daines Barrington, some of the Gwavas
MS. letters and songs, and the story of John of Chy-an-Hur.&nbsp;
These, written by men who spoke Cornish fluently and had no
theories and often no knowledge of philology, probably represent
what people really spoke in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.&nbsp; That faintness and even silence of final
letters, which seems to have been a characteristic of Cornish as
it is of French, was the cause that, in writing as phonetically
as they knew how, these practical speakers of Cornish often
omitted the ends of words, and made it seem as though their verbs
had largely lost their inflections.&nbsp; Words were spelt alike
which should have been differentiated&mdash;it was as though one
should spell <i>avais</i>, <i>avait</i>, <i>avez</i>, and
<i>avaient</i> all alike, and words were run together that should
have had at least apostrophes between them; but the grammar was
not always as broken-down as it looks, and by a comparison with
the older remains of Cornish it is not difficult to restore
approximately the proper spelling.&nbsp; The Cornish represented
in Lhuyd&rsquo;s writings has tended to confuse some
things.&nbsp; Lhuyd was a Welshman, and is constantly trying to
run off into Welsh, and he had for his teacher John Keigwin, who
thought that he understood the Cornish of the medi&aelig;val
dramas, but was often mistaken.&nbsp; Probably had a resuscitated
medi&aelig;val Cornishman read the dramas aloud to Keigwin, he
would have understood them quite as well as the ordinary English
board-school boy would understand St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles in
the Authorised Version, read by a revived Jacobean divine; but
the spelling and the medi&aelig;val handwriting, which he could
not always read, put him out terribly, and some very weird forms
and words are the result.&nbsp; Also Keigwin had, or thought he
had, a knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, which he uses on occasions
with dire results.&nbsp; Far be it from any Cornish student to
undervalue the <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>usefulness of Keigwin.&nbsp; But for
him, and for Gwavas and Tonkin, the work of reconstruction would
have been much more difficult than it is, and these writers
undoubtedly preserved a great deal of most valuable matter that
otherwise would have been lost, but their work needs to be used
with great caution, and the translations and original
compositions which they produced do not always represent quite
fairly the late forms of the language.</p>

54</span>CHAPTER I&mdash;SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION</h3>
<h4>&sect; 1.&nbsp; On the Pronunciation in general.</h4>
<p>In simple Cornish words of more than one syllable the stress
accent is generally, though not universally, on the last but one.
<a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; The vowel of this syllable has
usually its plain, clear <i>long</i> or <i>short</i> sound.&nbsp;
The vowels of the unaccented syllables are usually <i>obscure</i>
in the case of two of the broad vowels (<i>a</i>, <i>o</i>), and
<i>short</i> in the case of the thin vowels (<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>,
<i>y</i>) and of <i>u</i>, unless they are combinations of two
vowels, in which case they are always long; but <i>e</i> in a
final unaccented syllable is also generally <i>obscure</i>.&nbsp;
The <i>obscure</i> vowel is the sound of <i>u</i> in the English
word <i>until</i>, or <i>o</i> in <i>London</i>, and there is
very little, if any, difference in sound between the obscure
<i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>.&nbsp; When this sound
occurs, as it occasionally does, on an accented syllable, or
anywhere where it might be mistaken for a plain sound, it is
written, according to the spelling of this book, <i>&#259;</i>,
<i>&#335;</i>, or <i>&#365;</i>.</p>
<p>In words of one syllable ending in a consonant the vowel is
generally to be taken as <i>short</i>, unless it is marked long
(<i>&acirc;</i>, <i>&ecirc;</i>, <i>&icirc;</i>, <i>&ocirc;</i>,
<i>&ucirc;</i>, <i>&#375;</i>), or is a combination of two
vowels.&nbsp; In monosyllables ending in a vowel, that vowel
usually has its <i>long</i> sound, but as Cornish is largely
accented in ordinary conversation by <i>sentences</i> (as is the
case in Gaelic, and to a considerable extent in English), <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>many monosyllables are slurred over with no accent (as
<i>enclitics</i> or <i>proclitics</i>, according to whether they
follow or precede the word on which they depend), and with more
or less of the <i>obscure</i> vowel.&nbsp; The modern Cornish
intonation of English is probably a very fair guide to the
intonation of Cornish. <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>The consonants, especially <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>dh</i>,
<i>th</i>, are rather more lightly sounded than in English.&nbsp;
Any peculiarities of sound will be given under each
consonant.</p>
<p>During the period in which the existing remains of Cornish
literature were written, that is, between the twelfth and the
middle of the eighteenth century, the spelling was very
unsettled.&nbsp; There were at least six different systems, if no
more.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; That of the Cotton Vocabulary.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; That of the <i>Ordinalia</i>, with
a sub-variety in that of the <i>Poem of the Passion</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; That of the <i>St.
Meriasek</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; That of Jordan&rsquo;s
<i>Creation</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; That of Boson, Keigwin, and other
seventeenth and eighteenth century writers.</p>
<p class="gutindent">6.&nbsp; That of Lhuyd.</p>
<p>Not only did different writers differ from one another, but
various ways of representing the same sound were used by the same
writer.&nbsp; The earlier spelling shows a certain amount of
Welsh, old English, and old French affinities; the latest is
evidently modelled on modern English, which does not suit it very
well, and the transition from one to the other is not very
abrupt.&nbsp; It is the object of the present book to represent
the probable pronunciation of Modern Cornish by a system fairly
consistent in itself, but not too startlingly divergent <!-- page
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>from
those adopted by previous writers (or from that of Breton, where
coincidence occurs), and not too much encumbered with diacritical
signs.&nbsp; It is to some extent a following of Dr. Edward
Lhuyd, whose system, though rather clumsy and unnecessarily
puzzling in places, was on the whole very good and of great
value.</p>
<h4>&sect; 2.&nbsp; The Vowels<span class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>Simple: <i>a</i>, <i>&acirc;</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>&ecirc;</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>&icirc;</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>&ocirc;</i>,
<i>&#335;</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>&ucirc;</i>, <i>&#365;</i>, <i>y</i>,
<i>&#375;</i>.</p>
<p>Compound: <i>aw</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ey</i>, <i>ew</i>,
<i>oi</i>, <i>oy</i>, <i>ou</i>, <i>ow</i>.</p>
<h5>a.&nbsp; Simple vowels<span class="smcap">.</span></h5>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>a</i>, short, as <i>a</i> in <i>man</i>.&nbsp;
Before <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> it is generally sounded as <i>o</i>
in <i>not</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>&acirc;</i>, long, the lengthened sound of
<i>a</i> short, <i>not</i> as the English broad <i>a</i> in
<i>father</i>, or long <i>a</i> in <i>mane</i>, but as a broad
<i>a</i> is commonly sounded in Cornish English.&nbsp; Thus
<i>b&acirc;</i> would have something between the sound of the
English word <i>bare</i> (of course without the <i>r</i> trilled
at all) in the mouth of a correct speaker, and the actual sound
of the bleat of a sheep. <a name="citation56"></a><a
href="#footnote56" class="citation">[56]</a></p>
<p>In some words, and especially before a liquid followed by a
consonant, <i>a</i> tends to be sounded as <i>aw</i> or short
<i>o</i>.&nbsp; Thus <i>&acirc;ls</i>, cliff, <i>gwander</i>,
weakness, <i>wartha</i>, upper, are sounded <i>awls</i>,
<i>gwonder</i>, <i>wortha</i> or <i>worra</i>, and
<i>br&acirc;s</i>, great, is sounded <i>brawz</i>.</p>
<p>In unaccented syllables <i>a</i> represents nearly the sound
of <i>u</i> in <i>until</i>, or, as a final, the English sound of
<i>a</i> at the end of proper names, such as <i>Vienna</i>,
<i>Maria</i>, etc., which is more or less the final <i>e</i> of
German, <i>meine</i>, <i>deine</i>, etc., or perhaps the <i>e</i>
of the French words <i>le</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>me</i>, etc.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>3.&nbsp; <i>e</i>, short, as <i>e</i> in <i>men</i>,
<i>pen</i>, etc.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>&ecirc;</i>, long, as <i>ai</i> in <i>main</i>,
<i>ay</i> in <i>say</i>. <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>i</i>, short, as <i>i</i> in <i>in</i>,
<i>pin</i>, etc.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>&icirc;</i>, long, as <i>ee</i> in <i>seen</i>,
etc.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>o</i>, short, as <i>o</i> in <i>on</i>.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <i>&ocirc;</i>, long, as <i>aw</i> in <i>dawn</i>,
not as <i>o</i> in <i>bone</i>.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <i>&#335;</i>, obscure, as <i>o</i> in <i>London</i>,
<i>ton</i>, etc.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <i>u</i>, short, as <i>u</i> in <i>full</i>.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; <i>&ucirc;</i>, long, as <i>oo</i> in
<i>fool</i>.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; <i>&#468;</i>, obscure, as <i>u</i> in
<i>until</i>.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; <i>&#375;</i>, long, as <i>i</i> in <i>mine</i>.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; <i>y</i>, short, as <i>y</i> in <i>carry</i>,
<i>marry</i>, etc.&nbsp; This is used chiefly as an unaccented
final in a word of more than one syllable.</p>
<p>In the case of the letter <i>y</i>, there is a variation of
sound in such monosyllables as <i>n&#375;</i>, <i>wh&#375;</i>,
<i>j&#375;</i>, <i>h&#375;</i> under certain circumstances.&nbsp;
In this system of spelling the circumflex is omitted when these
words are enclitic.</p>
<h5>b.&nbsp; Compound vowels<span class="smcap">.</span></h5>
<p>Of these, <i>aw</i>, <i>ai</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ay</i>,
<i>ey</i>, <i>ou</i>, are only repetitions of the simple vowels
<i>&ocirc;</i>, <i>&ucirc;</i>, and <i>&#375;</i>.&nbsp; The
other four have sounds not otherwise represented.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>aw</i> has the same sound as <i>&ocirc;</i>.&nbsp;
It is very rarely used.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>ai</i>, <i>ay</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ey</i>, have
nearly the same sound as <i>&#375;</i>, rather more
diphthongalised.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>eu</i>, <i>ew</i> have the sound of <i>ew</i> in
the English word <i>dew</i>, the usual English long
<i>u</i>.&nbsp; This sound is also represented in Cornish by
<i>y</i> consonant followed by <i>u</i>, as in the word
<i>yu</i>, is, which has exactly the sound of the English
personal pronoun <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>oi</i>, <i>oy</i> have the sound of <i>oy</i> in
<i>boy</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>5.&nbsp; <i>Ow</i> has two sounds&mdash;(1) as an
unaccented final, as <i>o</i> in <i>bone</i>.&nbsp; This is also
its sound when it occurs without any consonant, in the possessive
pronoun <i>ow</i>, my, and the participle particle <i>ow</i>; (2)
in other cases it sounds as <i>ou</i> in <i>you</i>, and rarely
as <i>ow</i> in <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>Ou</i> has the same sound as <i>&ucirc;</i>, and
as the second sound of <i>ow</i>.&nbsp; It is the regular symbol
for that sound in Breton, and very commonly in the Cornish
dramas, where, as in Breton, <i>u</i> commonly represented,
approximately, the French <i>u</i>, which later became
<i>&icirc;</i> or <i>ew</i>.</p>
<h5>General Remarks on the Vowels<span
class="smcap">.</span></h5>
<p>In the Middle Cornish manuscripts the vowels are represented
in various ways, and there is a special uncertainty about
unaccented and obscure vowels.</p>
<p>Vowels were sometimes lengthened by doubling, or by adding a
<i>y</i>, and rarely, until Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>, by
adding a mute <i>e</i> after the closing consonant; but often
quantity was not indicated at all.</p>
<p>Long <i>&icirc;</i> (<i>ee</i> in <i>see</i>) was more often
than not represented by <i>y</i>, but, as in Welsh, <i>y</i> not
infrequently represented the obscure vowel (<i>u</i> in
<i>until</i>), and often a sound which later became a short
<i>e</i>, but in unaccented syllables was, as is not unusually
the case in English, more of the nature of the obscure vowel, or
perhaps something between that and a short <i>i</i>.&nbsp; Indeed
all unaccented vowels tend to become obscure, very much as they
do in English, and hence are variously expressed.</p>
<p>The <i>u</i> of the earlier MSS. probably once represented
approximately the French <i>u</i> or the German <i>u</i>, the
<i>u</i> of Devon and East Cornwall English, or the <i>ao</i> of
Scottish Gaelic, not exactly the same sounds, but very near to
each other.&nbsp; As in Greek and Welsh, this sound approached
nearer and nearer to <i>&icirc;</i> (<i>ee</i> in <i>seen</i>),
until in <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Cornish it ceased to be recognised as
having any <i>u</i> sound in it at all.&nbsp; In Welsh it is
still written as <i>u</i>, and in carefully spoken Welsh is quite
distinguishable from <i>&icirc;</i>.&nbsp; In Breton the sound is
still approximately that of the French <i>u</i>.&nbsp; In some
words in Cornish this sound became <i>ew</i> (as in the English
word <i>few</i>) and rarely <i>&ucirc;</i> (<i>oo</i> in
<i>moon</i>), but generally it became <i>&icirc;</i> (English
<i>ee</i>). <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a></p>
<p>What was once the sound of the French and Breton <i>eu</i> or
the German <i>o</i>, was represented in the MSS. by <i>u</i>,
<i>eu</i>, <i>ue</i>.&nbsp; Later this became <i>&ecirc;</i>
(<i>ay</i> in <i>may</i>).&nbsp; Thus, <i>dueth</i> or
<i>duth</i>, &ldquo;came,&rdquo; became <i>d&ecirc;th</i>;
<i>luen</i>, <i>leun</i>, &ldquo;full,&rdquo; became
<i>l&ecirc;n</i>; <i>due</i>, &ldquo;comes,&rdquo; became
<i>d&ecirc;</i>; <i>mur</i>, <i>meur</i>, &ldquo;great,&rdquo;
became <i>m&ecirc;r</i>.&nbsp; This change is found occasionally
as early as the <i>Poem of the Passion</i>.&nbsp; The rhythm
shows that <i>ue</i> and <i>eu</i> form only one syllable.&nbsp;
In the case of <i>lues</i> (=<i>luas</i>), many, which later
became <i>l&icirc;as</i> (or <i>leeas</i>), the rhythm shows that
the <i>u</i> and <i>e</i> did not form a single vowel.&nbsp;
Occasionally, as in the second person plural of certain tenses,
<i>eu</i> of the early MSS. became <i>ew</i>, which it was
probably intended to represent, but was often confused with
<i>ou</i> (=<i>&ucirc;</i> or <i>oo</i>). <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>The sound of <i>&ocirc;</i> or <i>aw</i>, as it certainly
became in later Cornish, was represented by <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>oy</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>oa</i>, <i>ao</i>, <i>au</i>,
<i>aw</i>.&nbsp; The tendency to pronounce <i>a</i> as <i>aw</i>
or short <i>o</i> before <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, doubled or
followed by a consonant, and sometimes single, is very marked in
the spelling of late Cornish, and in the present pronunciation of
place-names.&nbsp; There is no evidence of its age in Cornish;
but it is very common in English and Irish, though unknown in
standard Welsh or Breton.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>There seems no doubt, by the same evidence, that a long
<i>y</i> of older Cornish often became <i>i</i>, as in the
English word <i>mine</i>.&nbsp; Vulgarly, as with the English
long i, it sometimes even became <i>oy</i>.&nbsp; Boson writes
<i>choy</i> for <i>chy</i>, house, but Lhuyd writes it
<i>tshy&#775;i</i> or <i>tshei</i>, which last is its usual
modern sound in place-names.&nbsp; <i>N&#375;</i>, we,
<i>wh&#375;</i>, you, <i>j&#375;</i>, they, and <i>h&#375;</i>,
she, are written <i>nei</i>, <i>huei</i>, <i>dzhei</i>,
<i>hei</i>, by Lhuyd, and Jenkins of Alverton, using the earlier
form of the third person plural, written <i>y</i> in the Dramas,
spells it <i>eye</i>.&nbsp; Yet there are cases where the older
pronunciation is retained, and probably this was always the case
when the words were enclitic.&nbsp; Prof. Loth has pointed out a
similar change in the Quiberon sub-dialect of Vannetais Breton,
and that in some of the same words.</p>
<p>In the unscientific spelling of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, that is to say, in the system of every one except
Lhuyd, and occasionally of Gwavas and Tonkin when they followed
Lhuyd, the English values of the period were often given to the
letters; but the following were vowel symbols in general
use:&mdash;</p>

<p>A final <i>e</i> mute was often used to lengthen a vowel, as
in English.&nbsp; Many names of places and persons retain <!--
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>this <i>e</i> mute at the present day, and when the
preceding vowel is <i>a</i>, educated persons generally give it
the sound of the English long <i>a</i> in <i>mane</i>, but that
is a change analogous to the modern vulgarism of pronouncing
<i>clerk</i> as <i>clurk</i> instead of <i>clark</i>.&nbsp; The
proper sound of the Cornish <i>&acirc;</i> is still heard in such
words in the mouths of the peasantry.&nbsp; Compare such a name
as <i>Polglaze</i> in the two pronunciations.</p>

<h5>a.&nbsp; Simple consonants<span class="smcap">.</span></h5>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>b</i> has the same sound as in English.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>c</i> is always hard, being used only before
<i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>.&nbsp; The same sound before
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i> is represented by <i>k</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>d</i> before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i> is
usually hard, as in English, but, as in Gaelic, before <i>e</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>y</i> it has a sound approaching to <i>j</i>, or
like <i>di</i> in <i>soldier</i>.&nbsp; In the MSS. a soft
<i>g</i> was often written for <i>d</i> in such cases.&nbsp; It
is a common change in many languages.&nbsp; Cf. the Italian
<i>oggi</i>, to-day, for the Latin <i>hodie</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>f</i> has the same sound as in English.&nbsp; In
the MSS. it is often confused with <i>v</i>.&nbsp; As a final it
is very lightly sounded.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>g</i> is always hard, as in <i>get</i>,
<i>go</i>.&nbsp; The soft <i>g</i>, as in <i>gin</i>, is here
represented by <i>j</i>, but in the MSS. <i>g</i> was often used
for it.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>h</i> has two degrees of sound.&nbsp; As an
initial it is rather more lightly sounded than in English, except
when it is a mutation of <i>c</i> (see Chapter II.), when it is
more strongly sounded.&nbsp; Then, and when it occurs in the
middle of a word, it represents in a lighter <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>form the
guttural <i>c&rsquo;h</i> of Breton, the <i>ch</i> of German,
Welsh, and Gaelic, or the guttural <i>gh</i> of older
English.&nbsp; At the end of a word this is to be written
<i>gh</i>.&nbsp; It is a smooth guttural, as in Scottish Gaelic,
without the rasping sound which it has in colloquial Welsh or in
German.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>j</i> is sounded as in English.&nbsp; It generally
represents what was once written <i>s</i>.&nbsp; Lhuyd writes
<i>dzh</i> for this sound, and the MSS. often represent it by
<i>g</i>.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <i>k</i> is generally only used before <i>e</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>y</i>, or as a final.&nbsp; It has the same sound as
in English.&nbsp; It often happens in grammatical inflections
that a broad root vowel is changed to a thin one.&nbsp; In such
cases if the preceding letter is a <i>c</i> it must be changed to
<i>k</i>.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <i>l</i> has the ordinary English sound.&nbsp;
Sometimes a double <i>l</i> of earlier Cornish was written
<i>lh</i> (<i>telhar</i>, place, for <i>teller</i>).&nbsp; This
may perhaps represent the aspirated <i>ll</i> of Welsh, or (as in
Portuguese) the <i>l mouill&eacute;</i> (as <i>li</i> in
<i>valiant</i>).</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <i>m</i> has usually the same sound as in
English.&nbsp; When it follows a <i>short</i> vowel in an
<i>accented syllable</i> or a <i>monosyllable</i>, it has a
peculiar sound as though a <i>b</i> were prefixed to it, or as
though the speaker had a slight cold in the head.&nbsp; This
<i>b</i> was frequently written in the later MSS., and in the
mouths of less educated persons the <i>b</i> supplanted the
<i>m</i> altogether.&nbsp; Thus <i>lemmyn</i>, now, became
successively <i>lebman</i> and <i>lebban</i>.&nbsp; The vanishing
of the <i>m</i> altogether did not occur in monosyllables, and it
is undesirable to imitate it in other words.&nbsp; In the system
of spelling adopted in this book, the <i>b</i> will be written in
cases where it was habitually written in later Cornish, but even
when it is not written it is always to be sounded in the case of
<i>short</i> vowels in <i>accented</i> syllables or
<i>monosyllables</i>.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; <i>n</i> is usually sounded as in English.&nbsp;
When it <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>follows a <i>short</i> vowel in an
<i>accented</i> syllable or in a <i>monosyllable</i>, a <i>d</i>
sound (analogous to the <i>b</i> sound with <i>m</i>) precedes
it.&nbsp; This <i>d</i> is often written in the later MSS., and
will be used in this book in cases where it is regularly found in
later Cornish, but it is to be pronounced even where it is not
written.&nbsp; In words of more than one syllable <a
name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> the <i>d</i> often supplanted the
<i>n</i> (e.g. <i>henna</i>, that, became successively
<i>hedna</i> and <i>hedda</i>), and monosyllables were sometimes
made into dissyllables by it (e.g. <i>pen</i>, <i>pedn</i>,
<i>pedden</i>); but both of these are vulgarisms not to be
imitated.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; <i>p</i> is sounded as in English.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; <i>q</i> is sounded as in English, and is always
followed by <i>w</i>.&nbsp; It is generally used in an initial
mutation (see Chapter II.) of <i>gw</i>, but occurs occasionally,
followed by <i>w</i>, as a radical sound.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; <i>r</i> has the same sound as in correct English,
that is to say, it is very slightly heard when followed by a
consonant or at the end of a word, unless the next word begins
with a vowel, but, as in English, it often influences the
preceding vowel.&nbsp; Its full sound is trilled, not
guttural.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; <i>s</i> is the most puzzling of the
consonants.&nbsp; It had probably four or five different values
in the MSS., and might represent <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>sh</i>,
<i>zh,</i> <i>j</i> according to circumstances.&nbsp; As an
initial, or before <i>c</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>l</i>,
<i>m</i>, <i>n,</i> <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>,
<i>w</i>, it was generally <i>s</i>, as in <i>so</i>; as a final,
and before <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>v</i>, it
was normally <i>z</i> or as <i>s</i> in <i>rose</i>.&nbsp; But
between two vowels in the same word, or coming after another
consonant and followed by a vowel, or as a final followed by a
word beginning with a vowel and closely connected grammatically
with its predecessor, it had commonly the sound of <i>j</i>, so
much so that <i>g</i> soft was often substituted for <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>it,
and there are cases where even an initial <i>s</i> must have
meant <i>sh</i> or <i>zh</i>.&nbsp; Thus we find <i>cowsesow</i>,
speeches, written <i>cowgegyow</i>, <i>carensa</i>, love,
<i>carenga</i> (for <i>carenja</i>), and in place-names, though
we find <i>Nanskeval</i>, <i>Nanspean</i>, <i>Nanswidn</i> when
the epithet begins with a consonant, when it begins with a vowel
we find <i>Nanjizel</i> (=<i>Nans isal</i>, the lower
valley).&nbsp; Sometimes in late Cornish the definite <i>j</i>
sound so completely superseded the <i>s</i> or <i>z</i>, that it
or its equivalent, <i>g</i> soft or <i>dzh</i>, was always
written for it, and in such cases it is written <i>j</i> in the
present system of spelling, but in other cases the best rules
will be to pronounce <i>s</i></p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; As an initial; before <i>c</i>,
<i>k</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>,
<i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>w</i>; or when doubled, as
<i>s</i> in <i>so</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; As a final, except when the next
word, grammatically connected, begins with a vowel; or before
<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g,</i> <i>j</i>, <i>v</i>, as <i>z</i> or
<i>s</i> in <i>rose</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; Between two vowels in the same
word; after another consonant and followed by a vowel; or as a
final followed by a grammatically connected word, such as an
epithet, beginning with a vowel, as <i>j</i>.</p>
<p>For the last rule compare Mrs. Gamp&rsquo;s pronunciation of
English (in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>).&nbsp; There seems to have
been an inherent tendency to the <i>j</i>, <i>sh</i>, or
<i>zh</i> sounds in every Cornish <i>s</i>, <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> but especially in those which represent
a <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> of Welsh and Breton.&nbsp; The writer is
aware that this is a very inadequate discussion of the question,
but he does not wish to be unduly intricate, or to enter into a
deep phonetic explanation.&nbsp; Those who would study the
question more minutely are referred to an article by Prof. J.
Loth in vol. xviii. of the <i>Revue Celtique</i>.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; <i>t</i> before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i> is
hard, as in English, but <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>before
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i> has a sound approaching to that of
<i>ch</i> in <i>church</i>, or to <i>ti</i> in words ending in
<i>tion</i>.&nbsp; Sometimes <i>ch</i> is written and fully
pronounced where a <i>t</i> was formerly written.&nbsp; Thus
<i>ch&#375;</i>, house, was formerly <i>ty</i>, and in the
eighteenth century <i>t&icirc;</i>, thou, was pronounced and
often written <i>chee</i>.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; <i>v</i> is sounded as in English, but is often
nearly inaudible at the end of a word, unless the next word
begins with a vowel.&nbsp; Thus <i>ev</i>, he, is often written
<i>e</i> in later MSS.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; <i>w</i>, except in compound vowels, is always a
consonant, and has the same sound as in English.&nbsp; For its
sound before <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> see Compound consonants.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; <i>y</i> consonant is sounded as <i>y</i> consonant
in English, or as <i>j</i> in German.&nbsp; It is always
consonant when it precedes a vowel, unless it is written
<i>&#375;</i>, when it is a vowel, as in such words as
<i>cr&#375;es</i>, <i>t&#375;ak</i>, etc.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; <i>z</i> is only used as an initial, but it is
seldom used at all.&nbsp; The sound is that of an English
<i>z</i>.</p>
<h5>b.&nbsp; Compound consonants<span class="smcap">.</span></h5>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>bm</i>, <i>dn</i> represent respectively the sound
of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> after a short vowel in an accented
syllable or monosyllable (see <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>).&nbsp; There is
no vowel sound between the two letters.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>ch</i> is always sounded as in
<i>church</i>.&nbsp; It usually represents a former <i>t</i>, or
else occurs in borrowed English words.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>dh</i> is sounded as <i>th</i> in <i>thy</i>,
<i>the</i>, etc., the Welsh <i>dd</i>, the Old English and
Icelandic &eth;, the Modern Greek &delta;.&nbsp; In the MSS. it
is represented by <i>th</i> or
<a href="images/p65.jpg">
<img alt="Letter" src="images/p65.jpg" />
</a>.&nbsp; Lhuyd writes it &delta;. <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>4.&nbsp; <i>th</i> (written
<a href="images/p66.jpg">
<img alt="Letter" src="images/p66.jpg" />
</a> by Lhuyd) is sounded as <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>,
<i>thick</i>, etc., the Welsh <i>th</i>, the Old English and
Icelandic &thorn;, the Greek <i>&theta;</i>.&nbsp; At the end of
a syllable, especially after <i>r</i>, the sounds of <i>dh</i>
and <i>th</i> are very light and tend to become inaudible, and
are often represented by <i>h</i>, or omitted altogether.&nbsp;
Thus, <i>gwartha</i>, <i>porth</i>, <i>barth</i>, <i>lowarth</i>,
<i>gordhya</i>, <i>gortheb</i>, <i>kerdh</i> often appear as
<i>gwarha</i>, <i>gwarra</i>, <i>por</i>, <i>barh</i>,
<i>lowar</i>, <i>lowarh</i>, <i>gorria</i>, <i>gorreb</i>,
<i>kerr</i>.&nbsp; Thus also, <i>Porthgwartha</i> (in St. Levan),
is now written <i>Porthgwarrah</i> and pronounced nearly
<i>Pergworra</i>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>gh</i> is used at the end of words for the strong
or guttural <i>h</i>.&nbsp; Lhuyd writes a Greek &chi; for this
sound.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>ng</i> (written by Lhuyd with an inverted Irish
<i>g</i>) has the sound of <i>ng</i> in <i>singer</i>, not as in
<i>finger</i> or <i>manger</i>.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>sh</i> has the same sound as in English.&nbsp; It
is only used in a few words of English derivation.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; In <i>wh</i> the <i>h</i> is always sounded.&nbsp;
This combination represents the Welsh <i>chw</i>.&nbsp; Lhuyd
writes it <i>hu</i>.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <i>zh</i> has the broader sound of <i>sh</i>, or that
of the French <i>j</i>.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; In <i>gwl</i>, <i>gwr</i>, <i>qwr</i>, <i>wl</i>,
<i>wr</i> there is a very light but quite audible sound of
<i>w</i> before the <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>.&nbsp; So light is the
<i>w</i> that it was often omitted in the MSS.&nbsp; Thus
<i>gwlasketh</i>, kingdom, <i>gwr&icirc;g</i>, did, and the
mutation <i>wr&icirc;g</i> were sometimes written
<i>glasketh</i>, <i>gr&icirc;g</i>, <i>r&icirc;g</i>.&nbsp; But
this was incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There must have been among Cornish speakers a tendency to a
somewhat blurred sound of certain letters, as though there were
an obstruction of some sort in their vocal organs, not altogether
unlike that attributed <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>on the stage and in fiction, with
some foundation in fact, to the Hebrew race.&nbsp; This is shown
by the tendency to turn <i>s</i> and <i>z</i> into <i>sh</i> and
<i>zh</i>, and to insert <i>b</i> before <i>m</i>, and <i>d</i>
before <i>n</i>.&nbsp; In the English spoken in Cornwall at the
present day this tendency has quite disappeared, and the
pronunciation, though not always the same as the standard
English, is remarkably crisp and clear.&nbsp; Readers are
solemnly warned against attempting to base or support any
theories of Jewish or even of Ph&oelig;nician influence in
Cornwall on the above coincidence.</p>
<p>These directions for pronunciation must needs be only
approximate.&nbsp; The exact phonetics are not attainable.&nbsp;
The pronunciation of Cornish place-names forms something of a
guide to the old sounds, only one must be careful not to be
misled by the modern tendency to pronounce words as they are
spelt according to the English values of letters, and one must
also remember that there is no settled system of place-name
orthography.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE INITIAL MUTATIONS</h3>
<p>In all the Celtic languages there are certain partly
grammatical and partly phonetic changes of the first letters of
words, which are called by various names, the most convenient of
which is <i>initial mutations</i>.&nbsp; These changes take place
in Cornish when words beginning with the letters <i>P</i>,
<i>C</i> or <i>K</i>, <i>T</i> or <i>Ch</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>G</i>,
<i>D</i> or <i>J</i>, and <i>M</i> are preceded by certain
adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, particles, etc., which stand
in some governing or qualifying relation to them.&nbsp; Words
beginning with other letters, except occasionally <i>F</i> and
<i>S</i>, do not change their initials.&nbsp; Very similar
changes are often made in the case of the second halves of
compound words.</p>
<p>The mutable letters, <i>P</i>, <i>C</i> or <i>K</i>, <i>T</i>
or <i>Ch</i>; <i>B</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>D</i> or <i>J</i> form two
classes, with mutual relations to one another.&nbsp; A third
class, related to the other two, is formed of <i>F</i> or
<i>V</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>Dh</i>, and <i>Th</i>.&nbsp; Of these last
<i>F</i> and <i>H</i> are the only ones that can occur as primary
or unchanged initials.&nbsp; Of these</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>P</i>, <i>C</i> or <i>K</i>, and <i>T</i>
or <i>Ch</i> are called <i>tenues</i> or thin (or hard)
letters.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>B</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>D</i> or <i>J</i>
are called <i>medi&aelig;</i> or middle (or soft).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>F</i> or <i>V</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>Dh</i>,
and <i>Th</i> are called <i>aspirates</i>.</p>
<p>One set of <i>tenuis</i>, <i>media</i>, and <i>aspirate</i> is
called <i>labial</i> (or lip letters), a second is called
<i>guttural</i> (or throat letters), a third is called
<i>dental</i> (or teeth letters), from the parts of the mouth
most used in forming them.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>The <i>labials</i> are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Tenuis</i>, <i>P</i>; <i>Media</i>,
<i>B</i>; <i>Aspirate</i>, <i>F</i> or <i>V</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The <i>gutturals</i> are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Tenuis</i>, <i>C</i> or <i>K</i>;
<i>Media</i>, <i>G</i>; <i>Aspirate</i>, <i>H</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The <i>dentals</i> are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Tenuis</i>, <i>T</i> or <i>Ch</i>;
<i>Media</i>, <i>D</i> or <i>J</i>; <i>Aspirate</i>, <i>Th</i> or
<i>Dh</i>.</p>
<p>There is no difficulty in perceiving that the letters forming
each of these classes are closely related to one another; in most
languages they are interchangeable under certain conditions, and
the changes in the Celtic languages called <i>initial
mutations</i> are based upon these relations, though the method,
rules, and arrangement of these changes differ in the six
languages, as do also the names by which they are known.</p>
<p>In Cornish (as in Breton) the general principle is that (1)
the <i>tenuis</i> changes under some circumstances into the
<i>media</i>, and under others into a form of the
<i>aspirate</i>; and that (2) the <i>media</i> changes to a form
of the <i>aspirate</i> under some circumstances, and into the
<i>tenuis</i> under others; but that (3) the conditions which
change the <i>tenuis</i> into the <i>media</i> change the
<i>media</i> into the <i>aspirate</i>: while those which change
(4) the <i>tenuis</i> into the <i>aspirate</i> leave the
<i>media</i> unchanged; and those which change (5) the
<i>media</i> to the <i>tenuis</i> leave the <i>tenuis</i>
unchanged.</p>
<p>In this book we shall call the original or radical condition
of a word its <span class="smcap">first state</span>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thus <i>Pen</i>, a head, <i>Car</i>, a
friend, <i>T&acirc;s</i>, a father, <i>Blew</i>, hair,
<i>Gras</i>, grace, <i>D&ecirc;n</i>, a man, <i>Mab</i>, a son,
are in their first state.</p>
<p>The change of the <i>tenuis</i> to the <i>media</i>, or a
radical <i>media</i> to an <i>aspirate</i>, we call the <span
class="smcap">second state</span>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thus, the same words in their second state
are <i>Ben</i>, <i>Gar</i>, <i>D&acirc;s</i>, <i>Vlew</i>,
&rsquo;<i>ras</i>, <i>Dh&ecirc;n</i>, <i>Vab</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>The change of the <i>tenuis</i> to the <i>aspirate</i>
we call the <span class="smcap">third state</span>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thus, for the first three words the third
state is <i>Fen</i>, <i>Har</i>, <i>Th&acirc;s</i>.</p>
<p>The other four, beginning with <i>medi&aelig;</i> or <i>m</i>,
have no third state.</p>
<p>The change from the <i>media</i> to the <i>tenuis</i> we call
the <span class="smcap">fourth state</span>.&nbsp; It is commonly
called <i>provection</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thus, the fourth state of <i>Blew</i>,
<i>Gras</i>, and <i>D&ecirc;n</i> (the words beginning with
<i>tenues</i> or <i>m</i> having no fourth state) is <i>Plew</i>,
<i>Cras</i>, <i>T&ecirc;n</i>.</p>
<p>[It is to be noted, however, that none of these three words,
being nouns, would be likely to be subjected to this last change
in any real construction, for the fourth state is used almost
exclusively with <i>ow</i>, the particle of the present
participle of verbs, with the conjunctions <i>a</i> and
<i>mar</i>, if, and <i>maga</i>, as, sometimes with the verbal
particle <i>y</i> or <i>e</i>, and sometimes with the adverbial
particle <i>en</i>, so that it is generally applied to verbs and
adjectives.]</p>
<p>The following is a table of changes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>P</i> has two changes, to <i>B</i>
(second state), and <i>F</i> (third state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>C</i> (or <i>K</i>) <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> has two changes, to <i>G</i> (second
state) and <i>H</i> (third state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>T</i> (or <i>Ch</i>) <a
name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a> has two changes, to <i>D</i> (or
<i>J</i>) (second state) and <i>Th</i> (third
state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>B</i> has two changes, to <i>V</i>
(second state) and <i>P</i> (fourth state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>G</i> has two changes, omitted or changed
to <i>W</i> (second state) and <i>C</i>
or <i>K</i> or <i>Q</i> (fourth
state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>D</i> has two changes, <i>Dh</i> (second
state) and <i>T</i> (fourth state).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M</i> has one change, to <i>V</i> (second
state).</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Occasionally in a few words <i>F</i> changes in the
second state to <i>V</i>, and in one case to <i>H</i>.&nbsp;
<i>S</i> rarely changes to <i>Z</i>.&nbsp; There is one change of
<i>D</i> to <i>N</i> (like what is called the nasal mutation in
Welsh).&nbsp; This is in the word <i>d&ocirc;r</i>, earth, which
after the article <i>an</i> is <i>n&ocirc;r</i>.</p>
<p>In the following tables cases of the use of mutations are
shown.&nbsp; It is to be noted that <i>e</i>, his, is one of the
words which govern the second state, and <i>ow</i>, my, the third
state, and <i>agan</i>, our, the first state, while the particle
<i>ow</i> of the present participle governs the fourth state.</p>

states:&mdash;</p>

72</span>There are a few irregular mutations.&nbsp; Rarely a
<i>B</i> after the adverbial particle <i>en</i> changes to
<i>F</i> instead of <i>P</i>, e.g. <i>en fras</i>, greatly, from
<i>bras</i>, sometimes an <i>M</i> after the same particle
changes to <i>F</i>, sometimes an initial <i>G</i> becomes
<i>Wh</i>, not <i>C</i> or <i>K</i>, for the fourth state, and in
the MSS. there are other exceptional changes.&nbsp; The mutations
are very irregularly written even in the best MSS.&nbsp;
Sometimes a word is written in its first state when it ought to
be in one of the other states, and sometimes mutations are made
when they ought not to be, but probably the writers used them
correctly enough in speaking, without perhaps clearly recognising
the changes as they made them.</p>
<p>The rules for the use of the initial mutations will be given,
as occasion occurs, throughout the book, and they will be
tabulated at the end, where they will require less explanation
than they would if they were given now.&nbsp; But this chapter
should be thoroughly learnt and understood before going any
further, as these changes are a very important part of Cornish
grammar, and a habit should be formed of making them
correctly.</p>

73</span>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE ARTICLE</h3>
<p>&sect; 1. The definite article <i>the</i> is <i>an</i>, for
all numbers and genders.&nbsp; When the noun that follows is
<i>feminine</i> and <i>singular</i>, or <i>masculine</i> and
<i>plural</i>, its initial, if mutable, is in the second
state.&nbsp; If it is <i>masculine</i> and <i>singular</i>, or
<i>feminine</i> and <i>plural</i>, the initial is in the first
state. <a name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>When the article <i>an</i> is preceded by a preposition or
conjunction, and sometimes by other words, ending in a vowel, the
article loses its vowel and is written &rsquo;<i>n</i>.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>D&ecirc;n</i>, man, masc. sing.; <i>an
d&ecirc;n</i>, the man.&nbsp; <i>dh&ocirc;&rsquo;n d&ecirc;n</i>,
to the man.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Benen</i>, woman, fem. sing.; <i>an
venen</i>, the woman.&nbsp; <i>dh&ocirc;&rsquo;n venen</i>, to
the woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Tassow</i>, fathers, masc. plur.; <i>an
dassow</i>, the fathers.&nbsp; <i>dh&ocirc;&rsquo;n dassow</i>,
to the fathers.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Benenes</i>, women, fem. plur.; <i>an
benenes</i>, the women.&nbsp; <i>dh&ocirc;&rsquo;n benenes</i>,
to the women.</p>
<p>The apostrophe is not written for the elided <i>a</i> of
<i>an</i> in the MSS., but the preposition and article appear as
one word, <i>dh&ocirc;n</i>, <i>dren</i>, <i>han</i>, etc., for
<i>to the</i>, <i>by the</i>, <i>and the</i>, etc.&nbsp; But it
is better to write it, to avoid confusion, especially between
<i>a&rsquo;n</i>, from the, and the simple article,
<i>an</i>.&nbsp; There are certain cases of contraction which
have been accepted as single words, and in these the apostrophe
is not used.&nbsp; Thus <i>pandra</i> (=<i>pa an dra</i>,
&ldquo;what (is) the thing?&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;what is
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>it?&rdquo;) is used for the interrogative
&ldquo;what?&rdquo; but is never written <i>pa&rsquo;n
dra</i>.&nbsp; There are occasional further compounds of
<i>pandra</i>, e.g. <i>pandrus</i> (or <i>pendrus</i>)=<i>pa an
dra es</i>, or <i>pandryu</i>=<i>pa an dra yu</i>, both meaning
&ldquo;what thing is?&rdquo; <i>pandrama</i>=<i>pa an dra a
wrama</i>, &ldquo;what shall I do?&rdquo; <i>pandrellen</i>=<i>pa
an dra a wrellen</i>, &ldquo;what should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in the other Celtic languages, when a noun is followed by
another noun in the possessive appositional genitive, the first
noun has no definite article.&nbsp; Thus <i>ch&#375; an
d&ecirc;n</i>, the house of the man, not <i>an ch&#375; an
d&ecirc;n</i>.&nbsp; The same rule applies to a similar
appositional genitive in Hebrew&mdash;a curious coincidence
between two quite unconnected languages.</p>
<h4>&sect; 2.&nbsp; The Indefinite Article<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>As a rule a singular noun without any article expressed,
except in the case of a noun followed by the appositional
genitive, is considered to be in the indefinite state, and would
be translated into English by a noun preceded by the indefinite
article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>.&nbsp; But partly as a corrupt
following of English or French, and partly for emphasis, denoting
<i>a single one</i> (like <i>yr un</i> in Welsh), the word
<i>a</i> or <i>an</i> is sometimes represented by <i>idn</i>
(earlier <i>un</i>), one.&nbsp; This is rare, especially in late
Cornish.&nbsp; A similar indefinite article is common in
Breton.&nbsp; Occasionally <i>idn</i> or <i>un</i> was used, as
in Breton, with a verbal noun (or infinitive), to form what in
English would be a present participle.&nbsp; <i>Yn un
scolchye</i>, skulking, lit. in a skulking (<i>Passion</i>, 74,
2), <i>yn un garme</i>, shouting, crying out, lit. in a shouting
(<i>Passion</i>, 168, 1), <i>yn un fystyne</i>, hastening, lit.
in a hastening (<i>Passion</i>, 178, 1; 241, 4), but this
construction is not found in late Cornish.</p>

75</span>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE NOUN</h3>
<h4>&sect; 1.&nbsp; The Formation of Nouns<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>Nouns are either primitive or derived.&nbsp; Primitive nouns
have no special terminations to distinguish them from other
words.&nbsp; Derived nouns, chiefly abstract, are formed from
adjectives, verbs, or other nouns.&nbsp; There are also verbal
nouns which have the form of the infinitive of verbs.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Nouns are derived from adjectives and occasionally
from nouns and verbs, by adding <i>der</i> or <i>ter</i>.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>dader</i>, goodness, from <i>da</i>,
good.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gw&icirc;rder</i>, truth, from
<i>gw&icirc;r</i>, true.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gwander</i>, weakness, from <i>gwan</i>
or <i>gwadn</i>, weak.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>golowder</i>, brightness, from
<i>golow</i>, light.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tekter</i>, beauty, from <i>teg</i>,
beautiful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>whekter</i>, sweetness, from <i>wheg</i>,
sweet.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&icirc;thekter</i>, horror, from
<i>&icirc;thek</i>, horrible.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>melder</i>, sweetness (to taste), from
<i>mel</i>, honey.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>yender</i>, coldness, from
<i>y&ecirc;n</i> or <i>yein</i>, cold.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>splander</i>, brightness, splendour, from
<i>splan</i>, bright.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tewlder</i>, darkness, from <i>tewal</i>,
dark.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tewder</i>, thickness, from <i>tew</i>,
thick.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tanowder</i>, thinness, from
<i>tanow</i>, thin.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>powsder</i>, heaviness, from <i>pows</i>,
heavy.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>scavder</i>, lightness (of weight), from
<i>scav</i>, light.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>medhalder</i>, softness, from
<i>medhal</i>, soft.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>glanithder</i>, cleanness, from
<i>glanith</i>, clean.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span><i>m&#466;gilder</i>, warmth, from
<i>m&#466;gil</i>, warm.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>t&#466;mder</i>, heat, from
<i>t&#466;m</i> (or <i>t&#468;bm</i>), hot.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>downder</i>, depth, from <i>down</i>,
deep.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>sehter</i> (or <i>zehar</i>), drought,
from <i>segh</i>, dry.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ewhelder</i>, height, from <i>ewhel</i>,
high.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>crevder</i>, strength, from <i>crev</i>,
strong.</p>
<p>Some adjectives ending in <i>s</i> revert to an original
<i>t</i> in this formation.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>calletter</i>, hardness, from
<i>cales</i>, hard.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>goscotter</i>, shelter, from
<i>goskes</i>, sheltering.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ponvotter</i>, trouble, from
<i>ponvos</i>, trouble.</p>
<p>It will be seen that this <i>der</i> or <i>ter</i> answers to
the English termination <i>ness</i>, and may be added to almost
any adjective to form the corresponding abstract noun.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Abstract nouns are derived from other nouns or
adjectives by the addition of <i>eth</i> or <i>neth</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gwiryoneth</i>, truth, from
<i>gwiryon</i>, truthful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>cosoleth</i>, rest, peace, from
<i>c&#466;sel</i>, quiet.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>sk&icirc;antoleth</i>, wisdom, from
<i>sk&icirc;antol</i>, wise.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>folneth</i>, folly, from <i>fol</i>, a
fool.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>materneth</i>, royalty, from
<i>matern</i>, a king.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gokeneth</i>, stupidity, from
<i>goky</i>, a fool.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mescogneth</i>, <a
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a> madness, from <i>mescok</i>, a
madman.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gowegneth</i>, falsehood, from
<i>gowek</i>, a liar.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>roweth</i>, bounty, from <i>ro</i>, a
gift.</p>
<p>This termination answers more or less to the Latin <i>itas</i>
or English <i>ity</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Abstract nouns are derived from verbs by the addition
of <i>ans</i>.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>crejyans</i>, belief, from <i>cresy</i>
(or <i>crejy</i>), to believe.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>givyans</i>, forgiveness, from
<i>gava</i>, to forgive.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>deskyans</i>, learning, from
<i>desky</i>, to learn.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span

<p class="gutindent"><i>tristyans</i>, sadness, from
<i>trist</i>, sad.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tibyans</i>, thought, from <i>tibya</i>,
to think.</p>
<p>This termination answers to the Latin <i>antia</i> or
<i>entia</i>, and the English <i>ance</i> or <i>ence</i>.&nbsp;
It is generally added to the root of the verb.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Nouns signifying agents or doers are derived from
other nouns, adjectives, and verbs by the addition of <i>or</i>,
<i>er</i>, <i>ar</i>, or <i>yas</i> (earlier <i>iad</i> or
<i>iat</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>t&#375;or</i>, a tiler, from

<p>Many words in <i>yas</i> occur only in the Cottonian
Vocabulary, and appear there as ending in <i>iad</i> or
<i>iat</i>, but since all the Cottonian words in <i>iad</i> and
<i>iat</i> which do appear in later MSS. are made in the latter
to end in <i>yas</i> (or <i>ias</i>), and since it may be taken
as an invariable rule that all words ending in <i>t</i> or
<i>d</i> in Welsh or Breton, if they occur at all in Cornish, end
in <i>s</i>, any Cottonian word in <i>iat</i> or <i>iad</i> may
fairly be taken for purposes of modern Cornish to end in
<i>yas</i>.</p>
<h4>&sect; 2.&nbsp; The Gender of Nouns<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>Nouns are of two genders, masculine and feminine.&nbsp; There
is no neuter.</p>
<p>There is no rule whereby to tell the gender of a word, except
in the case of animate objects, where the gender simply follows
the sex.</p>
<p>There are only three grammatical cases in which gender matters
at all.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When a noun or an adjective preceding a noun is
preceded by the article <i>an</i>, the.&nbsp; If the noun or
adjective is masculine singular or the noun feminine, or the
adjective of either, plural, its initial remains in the first
state.&nbsp; If the noun or adjective is feminine singular or the
noun is masculine plural, <a name="citation78"></a><a
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a> it is changed to the
second state.</p>
<p>When a qualifying adjective follows a noun in the masculine or
in the plural of either gender, the <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>initial of
the adjective remains in the first state.&nbsp; If the noun is
feminine singular, the initial of the adjective changes to the
second state.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The pronoun of the third person singular, used for a
feminine noun, even when it signifies an inanimate object, is
<i>h&#375;</i>, she, not <i>ev</i>, he.&nbsp;
Examples:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>t&acirc;s</i>, a father; <i>an
t&acirc;s</i>, the father.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tassow</i>, fathers; <i>an dassow</i>,
the fathers.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mergh</i>, a daughter; <i>an vergh</i>,
the daughter.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>merhes</i>, daughters; <i>an merhes</i>,
the daughters.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>t&acirc;s mas</i>, a good father;
<i>mergh vas</i>, a good daughter; <i>an vergh vas</i>, the good
daughter.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tassow mas</i>, good fathers; <i>merhes
mas</i>, good daughters.</p>
<p>It will be evident, considering that a large number of nouns
and adjectives do not begin with mutable letters, that the
question of gender only applies to a limited number of nouns and
adjectives, and therefore presents but little difficulty.&nbsp;
Perhaps the best way to learn the genders of nouns with mutable
initials is to get accustomed to their sound with the article
prefixed.</p>
<p>The feminine equivalents of certain masculine nouns denoting
animate objects are represented, as in other languages, in one of
two ways, by the addition of a syllable or by different
words.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By the addition of <i>es</i>.&nbsp; This is the
regular form.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>arledh</i>, lord; <i>arledhes</i>,
lady.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>pestrior</i>, a wizard;
<i>pestriores</i>, a witch.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>coweth</i>, a companion, masc.;
<i>cowethes</i>, a companion, fem.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mow</i>, a boy; <i>mowes</i>, a girl.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>sans</i>, a saint; <i>sanses</i>, a
female saint.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>eneval</i>, an animal, masc.;
<i>enevales</i>, an animal, fem.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span><i>pehador</i> or <i>pehajor</i>, a
sinner, masc.; <i>pehadores</i>, a sinner, fem.</p>
<p>Except in the case of the other class of feminines, of which a
list is given below, it may be taken as a general rule that the
corresponding feminine of any noun denoting a masculine animate
object is formed in this way.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By a different word.&nbsp; These are mostly those
which denote relationships and familiar animals, and there are in
some cases, as in English, further words to denote the young of
both sexes, or the neuter.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ecirc;n</i>, man; <i>benen</i>, woman;
<i>flogh</i>, child.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gour</i>, husband; <i>gwr&ecirc;g</i>,
wife.</p>

<h4>&sect; 3.&nbsp; The Cases of Nouns<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>All cases except the genitive and accusative are formed by
prepositions, as in English.&nbsp; Of these prepositions some
govern one state of the initial and some another, as will be seen
in the chapter on prepositions, but when the article <i>an</i>,
the, comes between the preposition and the noun, the initial is
not changed by the preposition, but only, if at all (in the case
of a feminine singular or masculine plural), by the article.</p>
<p>The genitive, by which must here be understood (in its
old-fashioned sense) all those conditions under which a noun
would in English be preceded by <i>of</i>, or followed by
&rsquo;<i>s</i>, is formed in four ways, each of which has a
different meaning.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The genitive of possession is the appositional
genitive.&nbsp; This is formed by placing the noun that is in the
genitive immediately after the noun which it qualifies, or, if
the former has the definite article, or is qualified by a
possessive pronoun or prefixed adjective, with only these
intervening.&nbsp; No change of initial is made, <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a> except the usual change of feminine
singular or masculine plural nouns after <i>an</i>, or the
changes caused by possessive pronouns, etc.&nbsp; The first of
the two nouns must have no article.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ch&#375; d&ecirc;n</i>, the house of a
man, or a man&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ch&#375; an d&ecirc;n</i>, the house of
the man, or the man&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span><i>ch&#375; benen</i>, the house of a
woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ch&#375; an venen</i>, the house of the
woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent">But not <i>an ch&#375; an d&ecirc;n</i> or
<i>an ch&#375; an venen</i>.</p>
<p>If there is a succession of genitives, only the last noun can
have an article.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>darras ch&#375; gour an venen</i>, the
door of the house of the husband of the woman.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The inflected genitive.&nbsp; This, which only
exists, and that doubtfully, in the case of a few words, is
formed by the modification of the root vowel.&nbsp; It is one of
the common genitives of the Gaelic dialects, and as such is
important, for it is not recognised in Welsh or Breton.&nbsp;
Lhuyd gives five instances of it&mdash;<i>margh</i>, a horse,
gen. <i>mergh</i>; <i>mergh</i>, a daughter, gen. <i>myrgh</i>;
<i>pen</i>, a head, gen. <i>pyn</i> (used only in the
quasi-preposition <i>erbyn</i>, against); <i>wh&ecirc;l</i>,
work, gen. <i>wheyl</i>; <i>cr&ecirc;s</i>, midst, gen.
<i>creys</i>, but even these were very seldom used, and only
probably in a few expressions.&nbsp; It would seem that the
initial of the genitive word should in this case be in the second
state.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>r&ecirc;n vergh</i>, a horse&rsquo;s
mane.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The genitive of attribution, quality, origin, or
quantity, denoted in English by the preposition <i>of</i>, but
not expressible also by the possessive in &rsquo;<i>s</i>, though
in many cases an adjective might be substituted for it, is
expressed in Cornish by the preposition <i>a</i>, which puts the
initial in the second state.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>a</i>.&nbsp; Quality.&nbsp; <i>Arledh a
&rsquo;ras</i>, Lord of grace; <i>an Matern a wordhyans</i>, the
King of glory.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>b</i>.&nbsp; Origin.&nbsp; <i>an
T&acirc;s an N&ecirc;v</i>, the Father of Heaven (cf.
<i>Pater</i> de c&aelig;lis <i>Deus</i>, translated in the
English <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Prayer-book, &ldquo;O God, the Father
of Heaven&rdquo;); <i>d&ecirc;n a Gernow</i>, a man of
Cornwall.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>c</i>.&nbsp; Quantity.&nbsp; Words
denoting number, quantity, etc., generally adjectives or
numerals, may be followed by this form of genitive.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>l&ecirc;n a &rsquo;ras</i>, full of
grace.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>lower a &#375;s</i>, plenty of corn.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>milyow a bensow</i>, thousands of
pounds.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The genitive of material is rather the use of a noun
as an adjective.&nbsp; It differs from the appositional genitive
in that the first noun may have the article before it, and the
second does not, and that if the first noun be feminine singular,
the initial of the second noun is in the second state.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tolyer predn</i>, a platter of wood.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tre bredn</i>, a town of wood.</p>
<p>The accusative or objective is usually the same as the
nominative, but it is to be remembered that there are a certain
number of verbs which in English are followed directly by an
accusative, but in Cornish require the intervention of a
preposition.</p>
<p>The vocative is preceded by <i>a</i>, which signifies
<i>O</i>, or by a personal pronoun.&nbsp; The initial after
<i>a</i> and sometimes after the pronoun changes to the second
state.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mab</i>, son; <i>a vab</i>, O son.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>benen</i>, woman; <i>a venen</i>, O
woman; <i>ti venen</i>, thou woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>why princis</i> (<i>Res</i>. <i>Dom</i>.,
iii. 124), ye princes.</p>
<h4>&sect; 4.&nbsp; The Plural of Nouns<span

<p>There are seven ways of forming the plural of nouns.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In <i>ow</i> or <i>yow</i> (pronounced <i>o</i> or
<i>yo</i>).&nbsp; This is the commonest form, and would naturally
be used for most <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>new words.&nbsp; It answers to the
Welsh <i>au</i> or <i>iau</i>, and the Breton <i>ou</i> or

<p>Some which follow this form have peculiarities of their
own.</p>
<p><i>a</i>.&nbsp; Some double the last consonant, which has the
effect of shortening the sound of the preceding vowel, and if the
last consonant is an <i>s</i>, giving it the sound of <i>s</i>
instead of <i>z</i>.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>T&acirc;s</i>, father, <i>tassow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>f&ocirc;s</i>, wall, <i>fossow</i>.</p>

<p class="gutindent"><i>marrek</i>, knight, <i>marregyon</i>.</p>

contract the last syllable of the root.</p>

<p>This termination is the only one used for the plural of
adjectives.&nbsp; These are rarely inflected when in agreement
with a plural noun, but when used as nouns they make their plural
in this way.&nbsp; A large number of adjectives <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and also some
nouns end in <i>ek</i> or <i>ak</i>.&nbsp; It is also the regular
plural of words ending in <i>or</i> denoting an agent.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In <i>y</i>.&nbsp; This termination is more common in
Cornish than in Welsh or Breton, though it is not uncommon in
those languages also.&nbsp; It is often written <i>i</i> in the
MSS.</p>

<i>trahesy meyn</i>, stone cutters).</p>
<p>This plural is mostly used for words ending in <i>l</i> and
<i>s</i>, though not exclusively, and it occurs occasionally with
other words.&nbsp; When a word ends in <i>s</i> preceded by a
thin vowel, that letter is sometimes written <i>j</i> in the
plural.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; In <i>es</i> or <i>edh</i>.&nbsp; This is the
equivalent of the Welsh <i>edd</i>, <i>ydd</i>, or <i>oedd</i>,
and the Breton <i>ed</i>, though it is not necessarily used for
the same words.&nbsp; Sometimes the vowel is modified.&nbsp;

<p>6.&nbsp; By dropping the syllable <i>en</i> or <i>an</i> from
the singular; or rather in this case the singular is formed from
a plural, usually more or less collective, by adding the
individualising suffix <i>an</i> or <i>en</i>.&nbsp; The words to
which this <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>applies are mostly such as are more
commonly used in the plural, and the <i>en</i> becomes, as Norris
calls it, &ldquo;an individualising particle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ecirc;l</i>, leaves, foliage;
<i>d&ecirc;len</i>, a leaf.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gwr&icirc;hon</i>, sparks;

<p class="gutindent"><i>gwern</i>, alders; <i>gwernen</i>, an
alder.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>spern</i>, thorns; <i>spernen</i>, a
thorn.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>bannol</i>, broom (the plants
collectively); <i>bannolen</i>, a broom (to sweep with).</p>
<p>And many others, chiefly names of plants and animals of a more
or less gregarious nature.&nbsp; Some of these have other
plurals, formed by adding one of the plural terminations to the
collective plural.&nbsp; These would be used when the collective
idea was not required.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ecirc;l</i>, leaves (collective);
<i>delkyow</i> or <i>delgyow</i>, leaves (not collectively).</p>
<p>Some singulars in <i>en</i> form their modern plurals from a
lost collective plural, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. by dropping the
<i>en</i> and <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>adding one of the ordinary plural
terminations.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>asen</i>, a rib; <i>asow</i>, ribs.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gwillen</i>, a sea-gull; <i>gwilles</i>,
gulls.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; In <i>en</i>, with or without alteration of vowel and
contraction.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>k&#375;</i>, dog; <i>k&icirc;en</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>hanow</i>, name; <i>henwen</i> (formerly
<i>hynwyn</i>).</p>
<p>There is no general definite rule for the formation of
plurals; they must be learnt by experience.&nbsp; Some words are
found with two plurals, but this generally means a tendency in
modern Cornish to consider <i>yow</i> or <i>ow</i> to be the
normal termination, and to discard other endings in favour of it,
just as the plural in <i>s</i> in English has superseded all but
a very few other forms.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>escop</i> (or <i>epscop</i>), bishop;
<i>escobyon</i> or <i>escobow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dew</i>, God; <i>dewon</i> or
<i>dewow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>flogh</i>, child; <i>flehes</i> or
<i>flehesow</i> (<i>flejow</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ecirc;len</i>, leaf;
<i>d&ecirc;lyow</i> or <i>delkyow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>t&icirc;r</i>, land; <i>terros</i> or
<i>terryow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>enes</i>, island; <i>eneses</i> or
<i>enesow</i>.</p>
<h4>&sect; 5.&nbsp; The so-called Dual<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>Parts of the body which are double (ears, eyes, hands, arms,
shoulders, knees, etc.), when mentioned in reference to the two
ears, eyes, etc. of the same person, are expressed by a compound
with the numeral <i>deu</i>, two, prefixed to the singular.&nbsp;
The Welsh and Breton grammarians call this a dual.&nbsp; When
eyes, ears, etc. are mentioned as belonging to more than one
person, the plural is formed in one of the usual ways.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>l&acirc;v</i>, hand; dual
<i>deul&acirc;v</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>lagas</i>, eye; dual <i>deulagas</i>; pl.
<i>lagasow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span><i>scovorn</i>, ear; dual
<i>deuscovorn</i>; pl. <i>scovornow</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gl&icirc;n</i>, knee; dual
<i>deulin</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>elin</i>, elbow; <i>deulin</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>bregh</i>, arm; <i>deuvregh</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>bron</i>, breast; <i>deuvron</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>scoudh</i>, shoulder;
<i>deuscoudh</i>.</p>
<p>For <i>hands</i> in general the plural is formed from
<i>dorn</i> (which means more exactly <i>fist</i>),
<i>dornow</i>; there is, as in Welsh, no regular plural of
<i>l&acirc;v</i>.&nbsp; A variant of <i>gl&icirc;n</i> is
<i>penglin</i> (lit. knee-end), with a dual <i>pedndewlin</i>,
cf. Welsh <i>penelin</i>, elbow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Lastly, the plural of <i>d&ecirc;n</i>, man, is almost always
<i>t&icirc;s</i> (earlier <i>tus</i>), folk, though Lhuyd gives
<i>dynion</i> as well.</p>
<h3><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE ADJECTIVE</h3>
<p>Adjectives are primitive or derived.&nbsp; Primitive
adjectives have no specially characteristic terminations.&nbsp;
Derived adjectives are mostly formed by adding <i>ek</i> to a
noun or verb, which may be said to answer to <i>ous</i>,
<i>ful</i>, etc., in English.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gallos</i>, power; <i>gallosek</i>,
powerful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>own</i>, fear; <i>ownek</i>, fearful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>lowena</i>, joy; <i>lowenek</i>,
joyful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>marthes</i>, wonder; <i>marthesek</i>,
marvellous.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>moreth</i>, grief; <i>morethek</i>,
mournful.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ponfos</i>, trouble;
<i>ponf&#335;sek</i>, troubled.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>anf&ecirc;s</i>, misfortune;
<i>anf&ecirc;sek</i>, unfortunate.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>whans</i>, desire; <i>whansek</i>,
desirous.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>colon</i>, heart; <i>colonnek</i>,
hearty.</p>
<p>The feminine of an adjective is formed in two ways.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By changing the initial to the second state, if it is
mutable.&nbsp; This only happens when the adjective
<i>follows</i> a feminine singular noun.&nbsp; When the adjective
<i>precedes</i> the noun, singular or plural, and when it follows
a masculine singular noun or a plural of either gender, the
initial of the adjective remains in its first state, unless by
reason of other circumstances than agreement, e.g. preceding
prepositions, pronouns, etc., or when the article <i>an</i>
precedes an adjective qualifying a noun of feminine
singular.&nbsp; Unlike Breton, but like Welsh, an adjective
qualifying and following a masculine plural does not change.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>2.&nbsp; Rarely and irregularly, by the alteration of
the root vowel as well as by the change of initial.&nbsp; This,
however, though mentioned by Lhuyd and occasionally found in
MSS., was practically obsolete long before his time.</p>
<p>The plural of adjectives is formed by the addition of
<i>yon</i> or <i>on</i>.&nbsp; Rarely, chiefly in poetry, this
plural is found in agreement with a plural noun, but usually
qualifying adjectives are treated as indeclinable, but for the
initial mutation, and the plural form is only used, as a general
thing, when an adjective is used as a noun.</p>
<p>The normal position of the adjective is after the noun.&nbsp;
Sometimes it precedes it, and in that case it changes the initial
of the noun to the second state, unless the adjective is in the
comparative or superlative degree, when the initial is
unchanged.&nbsp; The adjectives that most commonly precede the
noun are <i>dr&ocirc;g</i>, evil; <i>hen</i>, old;
<i>l&ecirc;n</i>, full; <i>hager</i>, ugly; <i>fals</i>, false;
<i>cam</i>, crooked.&nbsp; <i>Mer</i>, great, may come before or
after.</p>
<p>The comparative degree is formed by adding <i>ah</i> and the
superlative by adding <i>a</i> to the positive, but as in English
they can also be formed by the use of <i>moy</i>, more, and
<i>moyha</i>, most.&nbsp; There are, of course, the usual
irregular comparisons.&nbsp; The comparative or superlative
adjective usually precedes the noun which it qualifies, though
for the sake of verse or on account of emphasis it may follow it,
sometimes with the definite article intervening.&nbsp;
<i>Than</i> after a comparative is <i>es</i> (older <i>ys</i> or
<i>ages</i>) or <i>vel</i>.</p>
<p>Examples of the use of adjectives:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>D&ecirc;n gallosek</i>, a powerful
man.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Benen deg</i>, a fair woman.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mergh dewon</i>, or <i>mergh dew</i>,
black horses.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Benenes teg</i>, fair women.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An hen dh&ecirc;n</i>, the old man.&nbsp;
(The more usual expression is <i>an den coth</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span><i>An hen venen</i>, the old
woman.&nbsp; (More usually <i>an venen goth</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An lowenegyon</i>, the joyful ones.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Brassah gallos</i>, greater power.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gw&icirc;n a&rsquo;n gwella</i> / <i>an
gwella gw&icirc;n</i> / <i>gw&icirc;n gwella</i> } the best
wine.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>whekkah es mel</i>, sweeter than
honey.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Bron Ewhella</i>, the highest hill (now
Brown Willy).</p>
<p>The irregular comparisons are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Da</i> (or <i>Mas</i>), good;
<i>gwel</i>, better; <i>gwella</i>, best.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dr&ocirc;g</i>, bad; <i>gw&ecirc;th</i>,
worse; <i>gw&ecirc;tha</i>, worst; but generally <i>lakkah</i>,
comparative of <i>lak</i> (loose, remiss, lax), is used to
signify <i>worse</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&ecirc;r</i>, great; <i>moy</i>, greater
or more; <i>moyha</i>, greatest or most; but also <i>bras</i>,
comp. <i>brassah</i>, super. <i>brassa</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>B&icirc;an</i>, little; <i>leh</i>, less;
<i>l&#375;ha</i>, least; but there is also a comp.
<i>behadnah</i>, and super, <i>behadna</i>, from an earlier form,
<i>behan</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ogas</i>, near; <i>nes</i>, nearer;
<i>nessa</i>, nearest.</p>

<p>When compound numbers are used, the noun follows the first of
them.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tr&#375; igans bledhan ha deg</i>, 70
years (threescore years and ten), or deg <i>bledhan war tr&#375;
igans</i>.</p>
<p>Larger compounds are made somewhat as in English.&nbsp; Thus
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1904 is <i>Bledhan agan Arledh
nownjak cans ha pajer</i>.</p>
<p>The later lists of ordinal numbers usually have <i>vas</i> for
the termination, but the practice of the older MSS., the analogy
of Welsh and Breton, and the very definite <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>sound of the
last syllable of <i>pempes</i> and <i>whethes</i> in the
traditional fragments collected by the present writer in 1875,
all point to <i>e</i> as the correct vowel.</p>
<p><i>Nouns which follow numerals are put in the singular
number</i>, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> unless they are preceded by the
preposition <i>a</i>, of.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>wheh d&ecirc;n</i>, six men, not <i>wheh
denyon</i> or <i>wheh t&icirc;s</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>tr&#375; mab</i>, three sons, not
<i>tr&#375; mebyon</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>pajer paw</i>, not <i>pajer pawyow</i>,
four feet (a name still used in the English of Cornwall for a
newt).</p>
<p>But sometimes, in a collective sense:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>mil a bensow</i>, a thousand [of]
pounds.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>wheh a vebyon ha wheh a verhes</i>, six
sons and six daughters.</p>
<p>The numerals, cardinal or ordinal, unlike certain of them in
Welsh and Breton, do not change the initials of the nouns which
follow them.</p>
<p>It may be well to add here certain applications of the
numerals.</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times, etc. are represented by the cardinal
numbers followed by <i>gweth</i>, time (in the above sense), with
its initial in the second state, <i>idnweth</i>, <i>deuweth</i>,
<i>tr&#375;weth</i>, etc.&nbsp; Sometimes <i>plek</i>, fold, is
used, as <i>milblek</i>, a thousand-fold.</p>
<p>Proportional parts are: <i>qwartan</i>, a quarter,
<i>hanter</i>, half, and for the rest the ordinal numeral
followed by <i>radn</i>, part, e.g. <i>tr&ucirc;ja radn</i>, the
third part.</p>
<p>The divisions of time are: <i>secund</i>, a second;
<i>minnis</i>, <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span

<i>d&ecirc;dh</i>, a day; <i>seithan</i>, a week;
<i>m&icirc;s</i>, a month; <i>bledhan</i>, a year;
<i>cansvledhan</i>, a century.&nbsp; &ldquo;O&rsquo;clock&rdquo;
is expressed by <i>&ecirc;r</i>; <i>tr&#375; &ecirc;r</i>, three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Half-past three&rdquo; is <i>hanter
&ecirc;r woja tr&#375;</i>=half-an-hour after three.&nbsp; Midday

<i>hanter-nos</i>.&nbsp; Half-past twelve (noon) is <i>hanter

<h4>&sect; 1.&nbsp; The Personal Pronouns<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>There are four forms of the Personal pronouns.&nbsp; These
forms are used under various circumstances, but they are mostly
reducible to a single letter with or without its vowel for each
person, the variations depending upon (<i>a</i>) the <i>state</i>
of that letter, and (<i>b</i>) whether the vowel is placed before
or after it.&nbsp; The vowel is elided in some cases, and
coalesces with another vowel in others.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; As the subject of a verb and
preceding it.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; As the subject or object of a verb
and following it.&nbsp; This is for some pronouns the same as the
first form, for others the first form with its initial in the
second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; As the object of a verb, but placed
between a particle ending in a vowel and the verb.&nbsp; This
form is used also for possessive pronouns of the first and second
persons singular when they are preceded by the conjunction
<i>ha</i>, and, or by a preposition ending in a vowel, or by
<i>en</i>, in.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; In composition with a preposition,
and for forming the persons of an inflected tense of a verb.</p>
<p>In the first and second the consonant is followed by a
vowel.&nbsp; In the third and fourth the consonant ends the
word.</p>

<td><p>1st form.</p>
<p>This last is the regular form in the latest Cornish.&nbsp; In
the earlier MSS. <i>y</i> only is used for <i>they</i>; later
<i>an gy</i> or <i>an dzhei</i> (as Lhuyd writes it) became
usual.&nbsp; It is only found in the MSS. of the end of the
seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century, and probably
originated in a wrong division of words.&nbsp; The third person
plural of most inflected tenses of verbs ends in <i>ons</i>,
<i>ans</i>, <i>ens</i>.&nbsp; If the pronoun were added, this
would take the form of <i>ons &#375;</i>, etc., as in <i>carons
&#375;</i> (<i>amant illi</i>), they love, and the usual
pronunciation of <i>s</i> would soon bring this combination to
<i>caronjy</i>, which is easily divided into <i>car
onjy</i>.&nbsp; The compound preposition form in later Cornish
often ended in <i>ans</i>, followed or not followed by the 1st or
2nd form of the pronoun.&nbsp; Thus in Jordan&rsquo;s
<i>Creation</i> (1611) we find <i>anodhans y</i> (from them) for
an older <i>anodhe</i>.&nbsp; This would give an additional
reason for the confusion.</p>

</table>
<p>The form in <i>e</i> is older (<i>dhethe</i>, <i>ganse</i>,
etc.), but became obsolete by the middle of the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; It will have been seen:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the first and second persons singular are <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>the only ones which possess the four separate forms
complete.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the second form of all but these two persons is
usually the same as the first form.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That the third form is not much used in later Cornish
except for the same two persons.</p>
<p>It may also be noted that though the full and emphatic
pronunciation of <i>h&#375;</i>, <i>n&#375;</i>, <i>wh&#375;</i>,
and <i>j&#375;</i> is that of the English words <i>high</i>,
<i>nigh</i>, <i>why</i>, and the first syllable of <i>jibe</i>,
when, as is often the case, there is no emphasis of any sort on
them, the same thing happens to them as commonly happens in rapid
speech in English to the word <i>my</i>, and the <i>y</i> ceases
to have the sound of <i>&icirc;</i> English, but has the sound of
a short (not obscure) <i>e</i> English.&nbsp; Thus in the common
Cornish &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; <i>m&ecirc;r</i> &rsquo;<i>ras
dh&ocirc; wh&#375;</i>, which is sounded as one word,
<i>mer&aacute;sdhawhy</i>, the <i>y</i> has the short sound which
the same letter usually has at the end of a word.&nbsp; But it
might happen otherwise.&nbsp; Thus the following sentences are
within the experience of most of us at the end of some simple
commercial transaction:&mdash;</p>
<p>Customer (carelessly, having received the article and paid the
money), &ldquo;Th&aacute;nk you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper (in a half-reproving tone), &ldquo;Thank
<i>you</i>, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Cornish the customer would say
&ldquo;<i>Mer&aacute;sdkawhy</i>,&rdquo; in the ordinary tone,
but the shopkeeper might answer &ldquo;<i>Merasdha
wh&yacute;</i>, <i>sira</i>,&rdquo; and would sound the pronoun
like the English word <i>why</i>, unless, being a good Cornish
speaker, he preferred to say &ldquo;<i>M&ecirc;r</i>
&rsquo;<i>ras dh&ocirc;</i> &rsquo;<i>gas honan</i>&rdquo;
(Thanks to yourself).</p>
<p>The same principle applies to <i>h&#375;</i>, <i>n&#375;</i>,
and <i>an j&#375;</i>, but less with the last, which is generally
treated as a dissyllable with the accent on the last
syllable.</p>

governs the first state:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a preposition ending in a vowel, after <i>en</i>, in,
changed to <i>e</i>, or after the conjunction <i>ha</i>, and,

father; <i>ha&rsquo;m t&acirc;s</i>, and my father.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>e&rsquo;m corf</i>, in my body.</p>
<p>Sometimes in these cases the preposition or conjunction is
combined with <i>ow</i>.&nbsp; This is especially common in
Jordan&rsquo;s play of <i>The Creation</i>.&nbsp; The initial, if
possible, is then in the third state:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a preposition ending in a vowel, after <i>en</i>, or
after <i>ha</i>, <i>thy</i> is represented by &rsquo;<i>th</i>,
generally governing the second state, but sometimes, when the
initial following it is <i>d</i>, the fourth.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>dh&ocirc;&rsquo;th d&acirc;s</i>, to thy

<i>a</i> &rsquo;<i>th tr&ocirc;k</i> (<i>R</i>.<i>D</i>., 1730),

<p>Very often these mutations were not written in the
Dramas.&nbsp; In later Cornish this form was not always used, but
one often finds <i>dh&ocirc; dha</i>, <i>ha dha</i>, <i>en

his father; <i>ha&rsquo;y d&acirc;s</i>, and his father.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Third Person Singular, feminine; English,
<i>her</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&icirc;</i>, governing the third state,
or when there is no third state, the first.&nbsp; It coalesces
with prepositions ending in a vowel and with <i>ha</i> in the
same way as the masculine:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&icirc; th&acirc;s</i>, her father;
<i>&icirc; gwlas</i>, her country; <i>ha&rsquo;i th&acirc;s</i>,
and her father.</p>
<p>In the earlier MSS. both these possessive pronouns were
written <i>y</i>, the only distinction being in the initial
mutation which followed.&nbsp; In the later MSS. <i>&icirc;</i>
is often written <i>e</i>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; First Person Plural.&nbsp; English, <i>our</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agan</i>, governing the first
state:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agan t&acirc;s</i>, our father.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Second Person Plural.&nbsp; English, <i>your</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agas</i>, governing the first
state:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agas t&acirc;s</i>, your father.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Third Person Plural.&nbsp; English, <i>their</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>aga</i>, governing the third, or failing
that, the first state:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>aga th&acirc;s</i>, their father; <i>aga
gwlas</i>, their country.</p>
<p>When preceded by a preposition ending in a vowel or by
<i>ha</i>, the three plural possessive pronouns lose their
initial <i>a</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>dh&ocirc;</i> &rsquo;<i>gas</i>,
<i>ha</i> &rsquo;<i>gan</i>, etc.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>The <i>a</i> of the last syllable of <i>agan</i>,
<i>agas</i>, <i>aga</i> is obscure, and is often found
represented by <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, or <i>u</i> in the MSS.&nbsp;
Even when not preceded by a vowel these words are often found as
<i>gan</i>, <i>gas</i>, <i>ga</i> (<i>gun</i>, <i>gen</i>,
<i>gon</i>, <i>gus</i>, <i>guz</i>, <i>ges</i>, <i>go</i>).</p>
<p>When a pronoun is the object of a verb in the infinitive or of
a verb formed with the auxiliary verbs <i>gw&icirc;l</i>, to do,
<i>menny</i>, to will, etc. and an infinitive, the pronoun-object
is represented by the possessive pronoun preceding and governing
(as to initial mutation) this infinitive:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ev a wr&icirc;g ow tholla</i>, he did
deceive me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>m&icirc; a vedn e grejy</i>, I will
believe it.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>m&icirc; a wr&icirc;g agas danvon</i>, I
did send you.</p>
<p>The reason of this is that in Cornish, as in the other Celtic
languages, the infinitive is counted as a verbal noun, signifying
<i>the act of doing</i>.&nbsp; This conception of the infinitive
explains many Celtic constructions.&nbsp; The literal force of
the above examples would be &ldquo;he did (or made) the deceiving
of me,&rdquo; &ldquo;I will the believing of it,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
did the sending of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similarly, when the object
is a noun, it really follows the infinitive as an appositional
genitive.</p>
<p>Frequently the second form of the corresponding personal
pronoun follows a noun preceded by a possessive pronoun.&nbsp;
This ought to be for emphasis, and, when it is so, the sound of
the personal pronoun would be its full sound; but it is
frequently merely redundant, and then it is enclitic, forming as
it were an unaccented additional syllable tacked on to the
noun:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agan T&acirc;s ny</i>, Our Father (nearly
&rsquo;<i>gun T&aacute;zny</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>dh&ocirc;</i> &rsquo;<i>m brodar
v&icirc;</i>, to my brother.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>agas levar why</i>, your book.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>herlya yu</i> &rsquo;<i>gan gwary ny</i>,
hurling is our sport.</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>The last sentence is a good example of possible
pronunciations.&nbsp; If it is an independent statement, the
phrase emphasis being on <i>hurling</i> and <i>sport</i>, it
would be accented <i>h&eacute;rlya yugan guaryny</i>.&nbsp; If,
however, we wish to say that hurling is <i>our</i> sport but
football is <i>yours</i> (<i>herlya yu</i> &rsquo;<i>gan gwary
n&#375;</i>, <i>mes pella-dr&ocirc;s yu</i> &rsquo;<i>gas gwary
wh&#375;</i>), the second phrase-emphasis would be on
<i>n&#375;</i> and <i>wh&#375;</i>, and they would be sounded as
the English words <i>nigh</i> and <i>why</i>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the personal pronoun as a genitive following the
noun, with or without the preposition <i>a</i>, of, was used
instead of a possessive pronoun, but in this case it was probably
not enclitic.&nbsp; Thus in a letter in verse by John Boson, in
the Gwavas MS., dated 1710, we find:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma goz screfa compaz</i>, <i>den fir
o</i> (for <i>a</i>) <i>v&icirc;</i>, your writing is correct, my
wise man, or, wise man of me.</p>
<p>And in a song by John Tonkin of St. Just in the same MS., the
probable date of which is about 1700, we find:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>An Prounter ni ez en Plew East</i>, our parson
who is in the parish of St. Just.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps more correctly in a copy of one verse of this song
in the Borlase MS.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Prounter nei (ez</i>) <i>en pleu Est</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the article <i>an</i> before a noun followed by an
appositional genitive seems incorrect, though one finds in the
earliest known version of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, given in John
Davies&rsquo;s Welsh translation of Robert Parsons&rsquo;
<i>Booke of Christian Exercise</i> (1632), <i>An Tas ni</i>,
though this may be a mistake for <i>agan</i>.&nbsp; In the song
quoted above one finds also:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span><i>Dewe reffa sowia an eglez ni</i>, <i>Ha an
prounterian da eze et an gy</i>, God save our churches and the
good parsons that are in them.&nbsp; And in Boson&rsquo;s version
of the Commandments we find <i>gwitha gerrio ve</i> for
&ldquo;keep my commandments.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>&sect; 3.&nbsp; Pronominal Prepositions<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>The prepositional form of the pronouns may be applied to
almost any preposition, but there are a certain number of common
cases in which the prepositions are modified by the composition,
vowels being altered or letters being inserted between the
preposition and this fragmentary pronoun, either for euphony or
as survivals of archaic forms of the preposition or
pronoun.&nbsp; The most usual of these modified forms occur in
the composition of the prepositions <i>a</i>, of or from,
<i>dre</i>, through, <i>gans</i>, with, <i>dh&#335;rt</i>
(earlier <i>dheworth</i> and <i>adheworth</i>, Welsh
<i>oddiwrth</i>), from, <i>orth</i> (or <i>worth</i>), at, to,
<i>rag</i>, for, <i>dh&ocirc;</i>, to, <i>war</i>, upon,
<i>en</i> or <i>idn</i>, in.</p>

<p>There are many various spellings of these words in the
manuscripts, and especially there is great uncertainty as to the
vowel which precedes the pronominal suffix.&nbsp; As the accent
is always on the preposition, the vowel of the pronoun is usually
obscure, and there is not so very much difference of sound in the
last syllables of <i>dredhov</i>, <i>genev</i>, and
<i>warnav</i>, but still there is a slight difference, and there
must have been even more in early days.</p>
<p>The older form of the third person plural ended in <i>e</i> or
<i>a</i>, <i>anedha</i>, <i>dredha</i>, <i>ganse</i>,
<i>orte</i>, <i>ragdha</i>, <i>dhedhe</i>, <i>warnedhe</i>,
<i>ynna</i>; but this form became obsolete by the middle of the
seventeenth century, and these pronominal prepositions were
assimilated to the third person plural of verbs.&nbsp; In this
the Cornish began by resembling Breton and ended by approaching
more nearly to Welsh.</p>
<p>The pronominal preposition form of <i>dh&ocirc;</i> has
variants for the first and second persons singular and first
person plural, <i>dhemmo</i>, to me, <i>dheso</i>, <i>dheso
d&icirc;</i>, to thee, and <i>dhenny</i>, to us.&nbsp; These are
formed by the addition of the personal pronoun in a fuller
form.&nbsp; In the cases of the other prepositions it is not
uncommon to add the personal pronouns at the end of the
pronominal compound, forming thereby a single word with the
accent on the last syllable.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span><i>genev v&icirc;</i>, with me,
pronounced <i>genav&icirc;</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>genough wh&#375;</i>, with you,
pronounced <i>genowh&#375;</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>ragon n&#375;</i>, for us, pronounced
<i>ragon&#375;</i>.</p>
<p>In later Cornish these pronominal prepositions compounds were
often neglected, and the prepositions were often used with the
second form of the personal pronoun, but this was only a corrupt
following of English, not to be imitated.</p>
<h4>&sect; 4.&nbsp; The Relative Pronoun<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; A simple relative, who or which, whether in the
nominative or accusative, is represented most frequently by the
particle <i>a</i>, governing the second state of the verb.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An T&acirc;s a wr&icirc;g N&ecirc;v</i>,
the Father who made heaven.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An N&ecirc;v a wr&icirc;g an T&acirc;s
e</i>, the Heaven which the Father made.</p>
<p>If the verb following the relative begins with a vowel,
<i>a</i> is often omitted.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ow th&icirc;s es genev</i>, my people who
are with me.</p>
<p>If the relative sentence is negative, <i>ni</i>, not,
coalesces with <i>a</i>, producing <i>na</i>.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>En le na v&ecirc; d&ecirc;n bisqweth</i>,
in a place in which man never was.</p>
<p>When the relative is the object of the verb, or is preceded in
English by a preposition, a redundant personal pronoun is added
after the verb, with or without a combined preposition, but a
preposition is never placed before the relative particle <i>a</i>
itself.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An d&ecirc;n a dhanvonas Dew e</i>, the
man whom God sent (lit. whom God sent him).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An d&ecirc;n a v&ecirc; an g&ecirc;r
cowses ganso</i>, the man by whom the word was spoken (lit. whom
the word was spoken by him).</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>2.&nbsp; <i>Neb</i> (earlier <i>nep</i>, and in late
Cornish sometimes <i>leb</i>) is also used as a relative, with
similar construction to that of <i>a</i> in the objective or
prepositional condition.&nbsp; Properly it includes the
antecedent, and should mean <i>he who</i>, <i>those who</i>,
<i>that which</i>, <i>those whom</i>, etc., but it is commonly
used as a simple relative, especially in late Cornish.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Agan T&acirc;s ny neb es en
N&ecirc;v</i>, Our Father who art in heaven, in one of the many
extant versions of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Another version is <i>Agan T&acirc;s ny leb
es en N&ecirc;v</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dhe</i> [<i>t&icirc;</i>] <i>nep yu ioy
ow holon</i>, thou who art the joy of my heart (<i>Res. Dom.</i>,
456).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An d&ecirc;n neb na&rsquo;n
gwr&icirc;g</i>, the man who did not do it.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Neb yu moyha</i>, he who is greatest.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An d&ecirc;n neb Dew a wr&icirc;g e
dhanvon</i>, the man whom God did send.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An d&ecirc;n neb an g&ecirc;r a r&ecirc;
cowses ganso</i>, the man by whom the word was spoken.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Neb m&icirc; e wr&icirc;g ragdho</i>, for
whom I did it (lit. whom I did it for him).</p>
<p>But, unlike <i>a</i>, <i>neb</i> can have a preposition before
it on occasions, with or without the redundant pronoun.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ch&#375; en neb na v&ecirc; d&ecirc;n
v&icirc;th</i> (<i>enno</i>), a house in which no man was.</p>
<h4>&sect; 5.&nbsp; The Demonstrative Pronouns<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; Absolute.&nbsp; <i>Hem</i>, <i>hebma</i> (orig.
<i>hemma</i>), this, masculine; <i>hom</i>, <i>hobma</i>
(<i>homma</i>), feminine.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Hen</i>, <i>hedna</i> (ong.
<i>henna</i>), that, masculine; <i>hon</i>, <i>hodna</i>
(<i>honna</i>), feminine.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An remma</i> (=<i>an re-ma</i>) is used
also for the plural <i>these</i>, <i>an renna</i> for
<i>those</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>2.&nbsp; In agreement.&nbsp; <i>An</i>&mdash;<i>ma</i>,
this, these, e.g. <i>an b&ecirc;s-ma</i>, this world.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An</i>&mdash;<i>na</i>, that, those, e.g.
<i>an d&ecirc;n-na</i>, that man.</p>
<p>The noun is placed between <i>an</i> and <i>ma</i> or
<i>na</i>, the latter being joined to it by a hyphen.&nbsp; In
some cases when the noun ends in a vowel the <i>m</i> of
<i>ma</i> is doubled, and the noun and demonstrative are written
as one word:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>an dremma</i>, this town (for <i>an
dre-ma</i>); <i>an chymma</i>, this house (for <i>an
ch&#375;-ma</i>); <i>alemma</i>, hence (for <i>a le-ma</i>), from
this place.</p>
<p>The same applies to the <i>n</i> of <i>na</i>.</p>
<p>When the noun is preceded by a preposition, <i>an</i> is
omitted: <i>war venedh-ma</i>, on this mountain, not <i>war an
menedh-ma</i>.</p>
<p>For emphasis, <i>keth</i> (same) is added after <i>an</i>:
<i>an keth d&ecirc;n-ma</i>, this very man, this same man.</p>
<p>In very late Cornish, <i>hebma</i>, <i>hobma</i>,
<i>hedna</i>, <i>hodna</i> were often corrupted into
<i>hebba</i>, <i>hobba</i>, <i>hedda</i>, <i>hodda</i>.</p>
<p>In the <i>Life of St</i>.<i> Meriasek</i>, <i>helma</i> and
<i>holma</i> are used for <i>this</i>, and it is easy to imagine
<i>helna</i> and <i>holna</i> for <i>that</i>.&nbsp; The
explanation suggested in Dr. Whitley Stokes&rsquo;s note is
&ldquo;<i>helma</i>=<i>hen lemma</i>, this in this
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cf. &ldquo;this here&rdquo; and &ldquo;that
there&rdquo; of vulgar English.</p>

GENERAL</h3>
<p>&sect; 1.&nbsp; The nucleus of a Cornish verb is its
root.&nbsp; This is used without any variation or addition for
the third person singular of the present tense, and for the
second person singular of the imperative.</p>
<p>Other parts of the verb are formed on this root in three
ways:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; By the inflected form, that is to say by the addition
of certain syllables indicating person, tense, etc., with or
without a modification of the root vowel.&nbsp; In older Cornish
the word thus formed indicated <i>person</i> as well as
<i>tense</i> without the addition of a pronoun, though if
emphasis on the subject was intended the pronoun was used before
or after it.&nbsp; In later Cornish the pronoun was almost always
added after the verb, and as the latter word often ended with the
same consonant as the former began with, the final consonant of
the verb was often, but incorrectly, omitted in writing, as it
was in sound.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Root <i>car</i>, love; first pers. sing.
pres., <i>carav</i>, I love, with pronoun, <i>carav v&icirc;</i>,
pronounced and often written <i>cara v&icirc;</i>; plur.,
<i>caron</i>, we love, <i>caron n&#375;</i>, often written
<i>caro n&#375;</i>.</p>
<p>The inflected form is common in early Cornish, but in the
later stages of the language it is hardly ever used, except <i>in
negative</i>, <i>interrogative</i>, <i>and dependent
sentences</i>, and in certain tenses of the verb <i>to
be</i>.&nbsp; Even when it is used, it is more frequently the
inflected <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>form of an auxiliary verb with the
infinitive or participle of the main verb.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By the impersonal form, as the Breton grammarians
call it.&nbsp; This has inflections of tense but not of person,
the latter being indicated by the personal pronouns, placed
before the verb, which, being immediately preceded by the
particle <i>a</i>, has its initial in the second state.&nbsp;
This verb is the third person singular of the required
tense.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Root <i>car</i>, third pers. sing. past,
<i>caras</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Impersonal form.&nbsp; <i>M&icirc; a
garas</i>, <i>t&icirc; a garas</i>, <i>ev a garas</i>, etc.</p>
<p>This form is frequently used in early and late Cornish for a
direct affirmative sentence, beginning straight off with its
nominative, or preceded only by <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>, etc.;
but not so frequently in late Cornish, as the impersonal form of
an auxiliary verb, with the infinitive of the main verb.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; By the auxiliary form, either inflected or
impersonal, with the infinitive or a participle of the main
verb.&nbsp; The auxiliaries are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>G&icirc;l</i> or <i>gw&icirc;l</i> (older
forms <i>gwrthil</i>, <i>gwithil</i>, etc.), to do.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Menny</i>, to wish, to will.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gally</i>, to be able.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>G&#335;thvos</i>, to know.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Bos</i>, to be.</p>
<p>(a).&nbsp; <i>Gw&icirc;l</i> is used to form several tenses,
and is used (1) in its impersonal form in principal affirmative
sentences, (2) in its inflected form in negative, interrogative,
or dependent sentences, with the infinitive of the main verb,
more frequently than any other form, for the present, preterite,
conditional, and imperative.&nbsp; Its use is similar to that of
<i>do</i>, in the Cornish manner of speaking English.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a wra cara</i>, I love, lit. I
do love.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>T&icirc; a wr&icirc;g cara</i>, thou
didst love.</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>In these two sentences, <i>wra</i> and
<i>wr&icirc;g</i> are <i>proclitics</i>, unaccented syllables
joined in sound to the word which follows.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mar qwressa an d&ecirc;n cara</i>, if the
man would love.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwra cara</i>, love thou (do thou love);
<i>gwreugh why cara</i>, love ye.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwrens e bos</i>, let him be.</p>
<p>(b).&nbsp; <i>Menny</i> is used as an auxiliary of the future
and conditional.&nbsp; In principal affirmative sentences it is
usually in its impersonal form, in negative, interrogative, or
dependent sentences always in its inflected form.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a vedn m&ocirc;s</i>, I will
go.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a venja m&ocirc;s</i>, I would
go.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A vednough why m&ocirc;s</i>? will you
go?</p>
<p>(c).&nbsp; <i>Gally</i> is used, chiefly in the present and
preterite, for &ldquo;can&rdquo; and &ldquo;could,&rdquo; but
also for &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;might.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a el m&ocirc;s</i>, I can (or
may) go.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a alja m&ocirc;s</i>, I could
(or might) go.</p>
<p>(d).&nbsp; <i>G&#335;dhvos</i> in the present is sometimes
used for &ldquo;can.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; &ocirc;r mos</i>, I can go (lit.
I know [how] to go).</p>
<p>These follow the same rule as the others with regard to the
use of their impersonal and inflected forms.</p>
<p>(e).&nbsp; <i>Bos</i>, to be, as an auxiliary, is used, much
as in English, with the present or past participle, to form the
continuous present, the continuous past, and the passive.&nbsp;
It is generally used in the inflected form in its present and
imperfect in any sort of sentence, but in principal affirmative
sentences it is generally used in the impersonal form for other
tenses.&nbsp; It can also be used with <i>gw&icirc;l</i> or
<i>menny</i> and <i>gally</i> as an auxiliary <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>to it,
while it is itself an auxiliary to another verb, but this is only
what is done in English with such expressions as &ldquo;can
be,&rdquo; &ldquo;will be,&rdquo; &ldquo;shall be,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<p>The use of the various forms of the verb will be found more
fully explained in the chapter on the construction of
sentences.</p>
<p>When the auxiliaries <i>gw&icirc;l</i> and <i>gally</i> are
used to form a passive, it is sometimes the auxiliary that takes
the passive form.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mar ny</i> wrer <i>y wythe</i>, if he be
not guarded (<i>Res. Dom.</i>, 341), <i>mar </i>keller <i>y
wythe</i>, if he can be kept (<i>Pass. Chr.</i>, 3058).</p>
<p>But in modern Cornish this would be more likely to be formed
with a double auxiliary:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mar ni wrello bos gwithes</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mar callo bos gwithes</i>.</p>
<h4>$ 2.&nbsp; The Tenses Of The Inflected Verb<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>The inflected verb is reducible to five tenses, with an
imperative, two participles, and a verbal noun or
infinitive.&nbsp; These are all formed on the root by the
addition of terminations, and sometimes by a modification of the
root vowel (indicated below by <i>m</i>).</p>
<p>The tenses and their terminations are:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Present or Future.</p>

<p>The Present Participle is formed by prefixing <i>ow</i> to the
infinitive, the initial of which, if mutable in that <!-- page
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>manner, is changed to its fourth state.&nbsp; If a
present participle governs a pronoun object, the latter in its
possessive form immediately precedes (and governs as to initial)
the infinitive, and is itself preceded by the preposition
<i>worth</i>.&nbsp; In late Cornish <i>ow</i> was often written
<i>a</i> or <i>o</i>.</p>
<p>Another participial form, common in Breton and occasionally
found in Cornish, has been already mentioned in Chap. III. &sect;
2.&nbsp; This is made by placing the preposition <i>yn</i>,
<i>en</i>, in, and the indefinite article <i>idn</i>, <i>un</i>,
before the infinitive or verbal noun.&nbsp; Its use is chiefly
adverbial.&nbsp; Thus, in the <i>Poem of the Passion</i> we find,
<i>yn un scolchye</i>, skulking; <i>yn un garme</i>, crying out;
<i>yn un fystyne</i>, hurrying.</p>
<p>The Infinitive or Verbal Noun is formed by adding <i>a</i>,
<i>ya</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>as</i> or <i>es</i>, <i>al</i> or
<i>el</i>, to the root.&nbsp; In some verbs the root itself,
without any addition, is the verbal noun.</p>
<p>The Past or Passive Participle is formed by adding <i>es</i>
to the root, with or without modification of the root vowel.</p>
<p>The Passive termination is <i>er</i> for the present and
<i>es</i> for the preterite, but in Modern Cornish the Passive is
almost always formed after the English model by the auxiliary
verb <i>bos</i>, to be, with the past participle.</p>
<p>The terminations <i>ma</i> and <i>ta</i> are often added to
the first and second persons singular of various tenses in
interrogative and subjunctive sentences, and in the case of the
first person even in ordinary narration.&nbsp; Norris maintains
that these are not forms of <i>m&icirc;</i> and <i>t&icirc;</i>,
but only an <i>a</i> suffixed to the verb termination, which in
the first person reverts to a primary <i>m</i> for <i>v</i>, and
in the second person reassumes a dropped <i>t</i>.&nbsp; This
theory is rather supported by our finding <i>a</i> occasionally
added to the third persons of tenses of the verb <i>to be</i>,
but <i>va</i> is <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>also found.&nbsp; Whether this is
the explanation or not, we find such forms as:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Pandra venta</i>? what wilt thou?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A wresta</i>? dost thou?&nbsp; <i>Mar
menta</i>, if thou wilt.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Pandra wrama</i>? what shall I do?</p>
<p>There are some few differences between the inflected verb of
the earlier MSS. and that of modern Cornish, and among other
changes the lighter termination <i>en</i> or <i>yn</i> of the
first person plural, and <i>ens</i> or <i>yns</i> of the third
person plural, in some cases had changed by Lhuyd&rsquo;s time to
<i>on</i> or <i>an</i>, and <i>ons</i> or <i>ans</i>, but
probably really the vowel is obscure.&nbsp; There was also
considerable uncertainty about the modification of the
vowel.&nbsp; Even in the early MSS. the change of vowel is rather
vague, but the general rule seems to have been that when the
termination has a thin vowel (<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>y</i>), a
broad root vowel (<i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>) is changed to a
thin vowel, usually in late Cornish to <i>e</i> (cf. the Gaelic
rule of <i>leathan le leathan agus caol le caol</i>, broad with
broad and thin with thin).&nbsp; But this is by no means
universal, and in some tenses, as in the imperfect and
pluperfect, is not found at all.</p>
<p>There is some confusion in modern Cornish about the
subjunctive or fifth tense.&nbsp; Norris considers that
Lhuyd&rsquo;s subjunctive is really, except for the third person
singular, the imperfect or second tense of the older MSS.&nbsp;
But it seems to be more like a form of the present indicative,
except in the third person singular, which is the old
subjunctive.&nbsp; Lhuyd&rsquo;s change of the first person
singular to <i>am</i> instead of <i>av</i> is not uncommon in
certain verbs of late Cornish, when this tense is used in a
subjunctive clause.</p>
<p>The inflected verb at the beginning of a sentence is often
preceded in Middle Cornish by the verbal particle <i>y</i> <!--
page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>(or before a vowel <i>yth</i>), which does not mean
anything in particular.&nbsp; <i>y</i> causes the third state in
verbs whose radical is <i>p</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>t</i>, and the
fourth state in those whose radical is <i>d</i>, and changes
<i>gw</i> to <i>wh</i>.&nbsp; In late Cornish it is rarely used
except with the present of <i>m&ocirc;s</i>, to go, and (in its
apocopated form <i>th</i> or as <i>&#259;th</i>) with the present
and imperfect of <i>bos</i>, to be.</p>
<p>A reflexive verb may be formed from any transitive verb by
prefixing <i>&#335;m</i> (older forms <i>ym</i>, as in Welsh, and
<i>em</i>, as in Breton), changing the initial to the second
state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>cregy</i>, to hang; <i>&#335;mgregy</i>,
to hang oneself.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>br&ecirc;sy</i>, to judge;
<i>&#335;mvr&ecirc;sy</i>, to judge oneself.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>disqwedhas</i>, to show;
<i>&#335;mdhisqwedhas</i>, to show oneself.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>gweras</i>, to help; <i>&#335;mweras</i>,
to help oneself.</p>
<p>Sometimes the prefix gives a mutual rather than a reflexive
sense.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&#335;msewa</i>, to follow one
another.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&#335;mladha</i>, to fight, contend (cf.
French <i>se battre</i>).</p>

VERBS</h3>
<h4>&sect; 1.&nbsp; <i>Bos</i>, to be<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>The verb <i>to be</i> in Cornish, as in other Aryan languages,
is made up of more than one verb.&nbsp; In Cornish it may be
divided in two parts.&nbsp; The first of these consists of two
tenses, a present and an imperfect, the second of the usual five
tenses, the imperative and the infinitive.</p>
<p>The first division, by means of reduplications and additions,
takes a variety of forms in the early literature, and there is a
considerable uncertainty about the exact force of these
forms.&nbsp; Some of them evidently mean little more than
elongations and contractions for the sake of metre.&nbsp; The
second division is formed with greater regularity on a root
<i>b</i>, changing under certain conditions to <i>v</i> (often
written <i>f</i>) and <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>There is little or no difference of meaning in these
forms.&nbsp; The lengthened form <i>&#259;thov</i>, or its
apocopated <i>thov</i>, is generally found at the beginning of an
assertion.&nbsp; <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span><i>Oma</i>, <i>osta</i>, <i>yua</i>
and their lengthened forms are used interrogatively or after
certain conjunctions.&nbsp; In the early literature the
lengthened forms were written <i>ythof</i>, <i>assof</i>,
<i>ossof</i>, <i>esof</i>, and even, with double lengthening,
<i>ythesaf</i>, <i>ythesef</i>, <i>ythesof</i>.&nbsp; The first
vowel is probably the obscure vowel (as <i>u</i> in
<i>until</i>), and the stress accent is on the syllable that
follows the verbal prefix, so that even the consonant of the
prefix is a little uncertain.&nbsp; Williams makes it <i>dh</i>,
but <i>th</i> seems more probable.&nbsp; In late Cornish the
vowel of the prefix was usually dropped.&nbsp; The personal
pronouns are generally added after this tense, so that it
practically becomes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thov v&icirc;</i>, <i>thos d&icirc;</i>,
<i>yu ev</i> (or <i>ev yu</i>), <i>thon ny</i>, <i>though
why</i>, <i>thens y</i> (pronounced <i>then&#375;</i>).</p>
<p>Occasionally the impersonal form of this verb is used,
<i>m&icirc; yu</i>, <i>t&icirc; yu</i>, <i>ev yu</i>, <i>n&#375;
yu</i>, <i>wh&#375; yu</i>, <i>&#375; yu</i>.&nbsp; The negative
is formed by adding <i>nyns</i> to the short form, <i>nynsov</i>
or <i>nynsoma</i>, <i>nynsos</i> or <i>nynsosta</i>,
<i>nynsyu</i>, etc.&nbsp; Similarly this tense may be compounded
with <i>mar</i>, if, <i>ken</i>, though, <i>may</i>, that, into
<i>marsov</i>, <i>kensov</i>, <i>maythov</i>.&nbsp; The <i>s</i>,
which is sometimes altered to <i>th</i>, is probably the
<i>th</i> of the verbal prefix.</p>
<p>There are two other forms of the third person present,
<i>ema</i> (or <i>ma</i>), plural <i>emons</i> (or <i>mons</i>),
and <i>es</i> (older <i>us</i>), or <i>esy</i> or <i>ejy</i>
(older <i>usy</i>, <i>ugy</i>).</p>
<p>(a).&nbsp; <i>ema</i>, <i>ma</i>, <i>emons</i>, <i>mons</i>
must, according to Lhuyd, always be used narratively, never
negatively, interrogatively (except after <i>ple</i>, where), or
with relatives.&nbsp; They must always precede their
subject.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ema &rsquo;n levar en ow ch&#375;</i>,
the book is in my house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ema levar en ow ch&#375;</i>, there is a
book in my house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Nynsyw levar en ow ch&#375;</i>, there is
not a book in my house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ple yu &rsquo;n levar</i>? / <i>Ple ma
&rsquo;n levar</i>? } where is the book?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&rsquo;Yu &rsquo;n levar &#365;bma</i>?
is the book here?</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>(b).&nbsp; <i>emons</i> is only used when the pronoun
<i>they</i> is the subject.&nbsp; When a noun is the subject,
whether singular or plural, a singular verb is used.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Emons &#375; en ow ch&#375;</i>, they are
in my house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ema &rsquo;n levrow en ow ch&#375;</i>,
the books are in my house.</p>
<p>(c).&nbsp; <i>es</i>, <i>esy</i>, <i>ejy</i>, are chiefly used
with relatives or interrogatively in the sense of &ldquo;is
there,&rdquo; &ldquo;is there not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An levar es en ow ch&#375;</i>, the book
which is in my house (in this case <i>es</i>=<i>a es</i>, which
is).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&rsquo;Es levar en ow ch&#375;</i>?&nbsp;
Is there a book in my house?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Nag es levar en ow ch&#375;</i>?&nbsp; Is
there not a book in my house?</p>
<p>In the first of these two interrogations the interrogative
particle <i>a</i> coalesces with <i>es</i>, in the second
<i>nag</i>=<i>ni ag</i>, <i>ag</i> being the same interrogative
particle, with a <i>g</i> added before a vowel.</p>
<p>The ordinary interrogative of this tense is merely the form

<p>The difference between the use of <i>ema</i>, <i>yu</i>, and
<i>es</i> is not quite so distinct in Cornish as between the
corresponding <i>y mae</i>, <i>yw</i>, and <i>oes</i> in Welsh,
but if there is any difference in meaning between <i>ema</i> and
<i>yu</i>, it is that <i>ema</i> has more often the sense of
<i>there is</i>, <i>it is</i>, and <i>yu</i> more commonly that
of <i>is</i> only; also <i>yu</i> can be used interrogatively and
negatively, while <i>ema</i>, except after <i>ple</i>, where,
should not be used interrogatively, and is never used negatively
at all.&nbsp; Its negative and interrogative equivalent is
<i>es</i>.</p>

<p>The change from <i>s</i> to <i>r</i> in this tense, and the
assimilation of the inflections to the present, does not occur in
the written language until the middle of the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; The personal pronouns were always used with this
tense in its late form, and the final consonants of the personal
inflections generally coalesced with the pronouns, and so were
omitted in writing, thus <i>therav v&icirc;</i>, <i>theron
n&#375;</i>, <i>therough wh&#375;</i>, were written, though
incorrectly, <i>thera v&icirc;</i>, <i>thera n&#375;</i>,
<i>thero wh&#375;</i>.</p>
<p>An alternative third person singular is <i>o</i>.&nbsp; It is
used with relatives as an equivalent of <i>a o</i>, who was, and
with negatives as <i>nynso</i>=there was not.&nbsp; It is in fact
the past equivalent of <i>es</i>, but it is often used in a
simple assertion also.&nbsp; The simple interrogative is
<i>&rsquo;erama</i>, was I? the negative interrogative is <i>nag
erama</i>, was I not? and the simple negative <i>nynseram</i>, I
was not.</p>

<p>The last form seems to have completely superseded the other in
late Cornish.&nbsp; It seems to be formed by taking the irregular
third person singular as a root, and forming the rest of the
persons from it on the analogy of the present tense.&nbsp; Where
it is found&mdash;and the first person <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>occurs as
early as Jordan&rsquo;s Drama of <i>The Creation</i> (e.g. <i>ny
wrugaf</i>, 1. 1662)&mdash;it is generally written without the
final consonants of the verb, which, as in the imperfect tense of
the verb <i>to be</i>, seem to coalesce with the initials of the
pronouns.&nbsp; One finds the forms <i>rig a vee</i>, <i>rigga
vee</i>, <i>rigon ny</i>, <i>rigo why</i>, <i>rig an jy</i>,
these being preceded by adverbs, conjunctions, etc., such as
<i>na</i>, <i>pan</i>, etc., which put the initial in the second
state, and the <i>w</i> being almost silent is omitted.&nbsp; The
form <i>wruge</i> (=<i>wr&icirc;ga</i>), occurs in <i>Origo
Mundi</i>, 2250, and <i>Passio Christi</i>, 930, for the first
person singular, preceded by <i>pan</i>, when.&nbsp; The same
word occurs for the third person in <i>O</i>. <i>M</i>. 423, and
in the form <i>wrega</i> in Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>,
2216.&nbsp; This is <i>wr&icirc;g</i> with the added <i>a</i>
(see p. 120).&nbsp; A form of the third person singular of this
tense, <i>ros</i> (for <i>wros</i>, second state of
<i>gwros</i>), may possibly be found in the <i>Ordinalia</i> and
in <i>St. Meriasek</i>, in the expression, <i>re Thu am ros</i>,
by God who made me.&nbsp; But it is more probably the preterite
of <i>ry</i>, to give, as it occurs also in the phrase
<i>re&rsquo;n arluth dhen beys am ros</i>, by the Lord who gave
me to the world.&nbsp; <i>Wraze</i> (=<i>wr&ecirc;s</i>, cf.

<p>This verb is chiefly used (as has been said) as an auxiliary
in the present and past tenses, in the sense of <i>can</i>,
<i>could</i>, or <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>.&nbsp; In direct
sentences the impersonal form is most usual, in negative,
interrogative, and dependent sentences the inflected form in the
second state of the initial, which is influenced by the particle
<i>a</i>, generally, however, not expressed, <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>or by
<i>na</i>, not.&nbsp; When the inflected form has been used in
the question, the inflected form is often used also, preceded by
the personal pronoun, in affirmative answers.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following is a complete paradigm of a regular verb,
showing the various forms.&nbsp; Most tenses have at least two
forms, the simple verb, whether in the inflected or impersonal
conjugation, and the compound, or verb with auxiliaries.&nbsp; In
late Cornish the compound is by far the more usual in almost
every tense.&nbsp; The general principal on which the different
forms are used is:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Affirmative Sentences</i>.&nbsp; Simple Impersonal or
Auxiliary Impersonal, generally the latter.</p>
<p><i>Negative</i>, <i>Interrogative</i>, <i>or Dependent
Sentences</i>.&nbsp; Inflected Simple or Inflected Auxiliary,
generally the latter, but the Simple Inflected is more common in
these than the Simple Impersonal is in affirmative sentences.</p>

<p>This tense is not necessarily used after conjunctions which in
other languages (Latin, for example) govern a subjunctive, but
rather when uncertainty, expectation, or contingency is

this tense and the imperfect.</p>

140</span>VI.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Future</span>.</p>
<p>In older Cornish the present, whether in its inflected,
impersonal, or auxiliary form, was commonly used to express a
future, and sometimes the subjunctive was used as a future.&nbsp;
Some verbs have an extra tense which is a specially inflected
future, resembling one form of the Breton conditional, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center">Singular.</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: center">Plural.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>1.&nbsp; <i>carvym</i>, <i>carvyv</i>.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>2.&nbsp; <i>carvyth</i>.</p>

<td><p>2.&nbsp; <i>carvough</i>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>3.&nbsp; <i>carvyth</i>, <i>carvo</i>.</p>
</td>
<td><p>3.&nbsp; <i>carvons</i>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is more commonly found in the impersonal form,
<i>m&icirc;</i>, <i>t&icirc;</i>, etc., <i>a garvyth</i>.&nbsp;
It is formed, as may be clearly seen, by suffixing the future or
subjunctive of <i>bos</i>, to be (perhaps in its sense of
&ldquo;to have&rdquo; <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a>), to the root of
the verb.&nbsp; (Cf. the suffixing of the present of <i>avoir</i>
to an infinitive to form a future in French, <i>je parler-ai</i>,
and its unamalgamated prototype, the future form, <i>resurgere
habent</i>, in the very low Latin of the antepenultimate verse of
the Athanasian Creed.) But in late Cornish the regular future was
formed by the auxiliary verb <i>menny</i>, to will:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mednav v&icirc; cara</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc;</i>, <i>t&icirc;</i>, etc., <i>a
vedn cara</i>, etc.</p>
<p>The forms <i>mednama</i>, <i>menta</i>, usually in the second
state of the initial, are used for interrogative and dependent
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A vednama cara</i>? shall I love?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mar menta cara</i>, if thou wilt
love.</p>
<p>The negative is either <i>n&icirc; vednav v&icirc; cara </i>or
<i>m&icirc; ni vednav cara</i>.</p>
<p>The latter form, with the <i>v</i> of the termination omitted
as being nearly inaudible, is used in Carew&rsquo;s <!-- page
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>phrase, <i>meea navidua cowzasawzneck</i>, I will speak
no English, for <i>m&icirc; na vednav cowsa Sowsnak</i>.</p>
<p>The passive is formed by the present of <i>menny</i>, the
infinitive of <i>bos</i>, and the past participle:&mdash;</p>

<h3><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE IRREGULAR
VERBS</h3>
<p>The irregular verbs are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>m&ocirc;s</i> (earlier <i>mones</i>), to
go.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ocirc;s</i> (earlier <i>dones</i>), to
come.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d&ocirc;n</i>, to bear or carry.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>dr&#375;</i>, to bring.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>r&#375;</i>, to give.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>g&#466;dhvos</i>, to know.</p>
<p>Of these, <i>m&ocirc;s</i> and <i>d&ocirc;n</i> are each made
up of two different verbs.&nbsp; The irregularities of
<i>d&ocirc;s</i>, <i>dr&#375;</i>, and <i>r&#375;</i> are due to
contractions, and those of <i>g&#335;dhvas</i> chiefly to its
being compounded with <i>bos</i>, to be.</p>
<p>There are irregularities also in the auxiliary verbs
<i>gw&icirc;l</i>, to do, and <i>gally</i>, to be able, but these
have been already given in Chapter IX.</p>
<p>In earlier Cornish the inflected forms of the irregular verbs
were freely used, but later these are comparatively rare, and the
impersonal and auxiliary forms became so much commoner that the
full inflected form can only be gathered from the early writings
and from the rather imperfect paradigms given by Lhuyd.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to give anything more than the inflected
verbs here, for the impersonal and auxiliary tenses can easily be
worked out from these on the model of the regular verb.&nbsp;
These are given without pronouns, though of course pronouns are
used, as with other verbs.</p>
<p>In the latest Cornish the infinitives of <i>m&ocirc;s</i>,
<i>d&ocirc;s</i>, <i>dr&#375;</i>, <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span><i>r&#375;</i>, were often used colloquially to express
the imperative, without much discrimination between singular and
plural.&nbsp; These verbs, especially <i>m&ocirc;s</i> and
<i>d&ocirc;s</i>, are generally found in late Cornish in the
auxiliary form with <i>gw&icirc;l</i> and <i>menny</i>, but
rarely in the simple inflected.</p>

CONJUNCTIONS, ADVERBS</h3>
<p>&sect; 1.&nbsp; Prepositions are of two kinds, simple and
compound.&nbsp; Simple prepositions govern various states of the
initial.&nbsp; Compound prepositions, when, as is generally the
case, they are made up of a simple preposition and a noun, govern
the first state, for the noun which follows is really in the
appositional genitive.&nbsp; If a compound preposition govern a
personal pronoun, the latter is often placed, in its possessive
form, between the two component parts of the preposition,
governing the initial of the noun-half of it.&nbsp; Sometimes,
however, the second part of a compound preposition is a simple
preposition, and in that case the government is that of the last
preposition of the compound.</p>

EXPLETIVES</h3>
<p>Cornish is a disappointing language in respect of swearwords,
for it is by no means rich in those &ldquo;ornaments to
conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Except for a few very distressing
expressions, now better forgotten, which are put into the mouths
of the evil characters in the Dramas, the swears are mostly quite
harmless, and even pious.&nbsp; It is not at all difficult or
morally dangerous to learn to swear in Cornish.</p>
<p>Surprise is generally expressed by <i>Re
Var&icirc;a</i>!&nbsp; By Mary!&nbsp; By Our Lady! shortened at
times to <i>Ar&icirc;a</i>! and <i>R&icirc;a</i>!&nbsp; This is
used as an Englishman might say &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; or a Frenchman
&ldquo;<i>Dame</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there is an element of annoyance mingled with the surprise,
<i>An Jowl</i>! The Devil, may be mentioned with effect, perhaps
by those to whom <i>Re Var&icirc;a</i>! savours too much of
Popery; but <i>Re Var&icirc;a</i>! is in better taste.&nbsp;
<i>An Jowl</i> may be used, as in English, after words signifying
<i>where</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>when</i>, to strengthen
a question.</p>
<p>An assertion is strengthened by the use of the name of a
saint, preferably the patron of one&rsquo;s own parish (though
any Cornishman may swear by St. Michael <a

usually omitted.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Re Y&ecirc;st</i>! By St. Just!&nbsp;
<i>Re G&#335;lom</i>! By St. Columb!&nbsp; <i>Re &Icirc;a</i>! By
St. Ia [Ives].&nbsp; <i>Re Vihal</i>! or <i>M&icirc;hal</i>! By
St. Michael.</p>
<p>A little stronger, for those whose principles will allow them
to mention it, is <i>Re&rsquo;n Offeren</i>! By the Mass! and
some bold, bad persons have been known under great pressure to
say <i>Re Dhew</i>!&nbsp; In the Dramas, <i>Re thu am ros</i>
(<i>Re Dhew a&rsquo;m ros</i>), By God who made me! (or who gave
me) is a more elaborate form of this swear.&nbsp; One also finds
<i>Abarth Dew</i>, On God&rsquo;s part=In God&rsquo;s name, and
in the mouths of pagans, <i>Abarth Malan</i> (a Celtic goddess)
and even <i>Abarth Satnas</i>.</p>
<p>Ill-temper is generally expressed by variations on
<i>mollath</i>, pl. <i>mollathow</i>, curse.&nbsp; A moderate
amount of anger may be indicated by <i>Mollath</i>! or
<i>Mollathow</i>! alone, or <i>Mollathow dheugh</i>! Curses to
you! or <i>Mollath warnough</i>! A curse upon you!&nbsp; A little
more is expressed by specifying the number, generally large, of
these curses, <i>Mil mollath warnough</i>! or even <i>Cans mil
mollath warnough</i>!</p>
<p>Some, moved by very great indignation, have been known to say
<i>Mollath Dew warnas</i>! God&rsquo;s curse upon thee! and Carew
in his Survey of Cornwall of 1602 gives a by no means nice phrase
(which he spells all anyhow and translates wrong), <i>Mollath Dew
en dha &rsquo;las</i>! The curse of God in thy belly!&nbsp;
Another serio-comic but rather cryptic expletive, peculiar to
Camborne, or at any rate to the Drama of <i>St. Meriasek</i>, is
<i>Mollath Dew en gegin</i>! God&rsquo;s curse in the
kitchen!&nbsp; It does not seem to mean anything in particular,
except perhaps that one&rsquo;s food may not agree with one,
though it makes quite as much sense as the &ldquo;universal
adjective&rdquo; of English <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>swearing,
and is a good deal less offensive.&nbsp; <i>Venjens</i>, a
borrowed English word, may be substituted for <i>Mollath</i>. <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a>&nbsp; One finds <i>Mil venjens
warnas</i>! and even <i>Venjens en dha &rsquo;las</i>!&nbsp; But
all these last expressions represent unusually violent states of
mind, and cannot be recommended for general use; for if one were
to use up such expletives as these on matters of little moment,
there would be nothing left for state occasions.</p>
<p>The expressions <i>Malbe</i>, <i>Malbew</i>, <i>Malbew
dam</i>, <i>Malbe dam</i>, found in <i>The Creation</i> and in
<i>St. Meriasek</i>, are considered by Prof. Loth to be
maledictions referring to the French expression <i>Mal beau or
Beau mal</i>, a euphonism for epilepsy, so that <i>Malbe dam</i>
has no connection with the similar sound of part of it in
English, but only means &ldquo;Epilepsy to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth century speakers of Cornish
sometimes wished to express contempt or dislike by abusive
terms.&nbsp; These often take the form of epithets added to the
word <i>pedn</i>, head.&nbsp; Thus, <i>Pedn br&acirc;s</i>,
literally &ldquo;great head,&rdquo; is equivalent to the impolite
English &ldquo;fat-head&rdquo;; <i>Pedn Jowl</i>, devil&rsquo;s
head; <i>Pedn mousak</i>, stinking head; these three are given as
common terms of abuse by Carew.&nbsp; When the late Mrs. Dolly
Pentreath was at all put out, she is reported to have used the
term <i>Cronak an hagar deu</i> (The ugly black toad), and there
are several equally uncomplimentary epithets scattered up and
down among the Dramas.&nbsp; But these words do not accord with
the polite manners of those who belong to the most gentlemanlike
race, except the Scottish Highlanders, in all Christendom, and
those Cornishmen who require that their conversation should be a
little more forcible than &ldquo;yea&rdquo; and &ldquo;nay&rdquo;
(for which, by the way, there is no real Cornish) are recommended
not to go beyond <i>Re Var&icirc;a</i>, <i>Re&rsquo;n
Offeren</i>, and an invocation <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>of St.
Michael of the Mount, or of the patron saints of their own
parishes.&nbsp; What would happen if one were to swear by the
patron of some other parish does not appear, but probably, if a
St. Ives man were to strengthen his assertion by an appeal to St.
Meriasek of Camborne, instead of his own St. Ia, he might be
suspected of a wilful economy of truth.&nbsp; The more forcible
expressions may be left to the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon,&rdquo; for
Cornishmen and Celts generally, even of the lowest position, are
not, and never have been, foul-mouthed.</p>
<p>The usual interjections, Oh! Ah! Alas! are borrowed from
English.&nbsp; Woe! is expressed by <i>Trew</i>!&nbsp; Woe is me!
is <i>Gov&icirc;</i>!&nbsp; Woe to him!&nbsp; <i>Goev</i>!
compounds of <i>gew</i>, woe, with pronouns.</p>
<p>Lo, Behold (the <i>voila</i>, <i>voici</i> of French) is
expressed by <i>otta</i> (older forms <i>awatta</i>,
<i>awatte</i>, <i>wette</i>, <i>otte</i>=perhaps <i>a wel
d&icirc;</i>? dost thou see?).&nbsp; This combines with pronouns,
e.g. <i>ottav&icirc;</i>, &ldquo;me voici,&rdquo;
<i>ottad&icirc;</i>, <i>ottav&ecirc;</i> or <i>ottensa</i>,
<i>ottany</i>, <i>ottawhy</i>, <i>ottanjy</i>.&nbsp; These
compounds are often followed by a participle, e.g.
<i>ottav&icirc; pares</i>, behold me prepared.&nbsp; The
distinction of <i>voila</i> and <i>voici</i> is expressed by
<i>ottama</i> and <i>ottana</i>.</p>
<h3><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE CONSTRUCTION
OF SENTENCES, IDIOMS, ETC.</h3>
<p>&sect; 1. In later Cornish there was a strong tendency to
assimilate the order of words and the construction of sentences
to those of English, but nevertheless certain idioms persisted
throughout.</p>
<p>In English the normal order of words in a simple sentence
is:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Subject&mdash;Verb&mdash;Complement of
Predicate (Object, etc.).</p>
<p>This order is used in Cornish also when the impersonal form of
the main verb or of the auxiliary is used, and the object is not
a personal pronoun.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dew a gar an b&ecirc;s</i>, God loveth
the world.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dew a wra cara an b&ecirc;s</i>, God doth
love the world.</p>
<p>One of these two forms is the most usual in a direct
affirmative principal sentence when the object is not a
pronoun.</p>
<p>If the object is a pronoun, the order is:&mdash;</p>
<p
class="gutindent">Subject&mdash;Particle&mdash;Object&mdash;Verb.</p>
<p>Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dew a&rsquo;th gar</i>, God loveth
thee.</p>
<p>Or:&mdash;</p>
<p
class="gutindent">Subject&mdash;Particle&mdash;Auxiliary&mdash;Pronoun
in the Possessive Form&mdash;Infinitive of Main Verb.</p>
<p>Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dew a wra dha gara</i>, God doth love
thee.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>If the auxiliary verb is <i>bos</i>, to be, it often
happens that the inflected form of it is used in an affirmative
sentence when the tense is the continuous present or
imperfect.&nbsp; In these cases the order is:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Auxiliary
Verb&mdash;Subject&mdash;Participle of Main
Verb&mdash;Complement.</p>
<p>Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thov v&icirc; ow m&ocirc;s dh&ocirc;
Loundres</i>, I am going to London.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Therough why ow t&ocirc;s adre</i>, you
were coming home.</p>
<p>But with the preterite tense the simple impersonal form is
more usual.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a v&ecirc; gennes en Kernow</i>,
I was born in Cornwall.</p>
<p>The same applies to the present and imperfect of <i>bos</i>
when it is not an auxiliary.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thov v&icirc; lowen dh&ocirc; &rsquo;gas
gwelas</i>, I am glad to see you.</p>
<p>The inflected form of the verb is rare in simple direct
affirmative sentences, except when it is used as a Celtic
substitute for &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be used in verse,
but it is rather affected in prose.&nbsp; In negative,
interrogative, and dependent sentences it is the only form to
use, but even then it is the inflected auxiliaries, parts of
<i>gw&icirc;l</i>, to do, <i>menny</i>, to will, <i>gally</i>, to
be able, etc., with the infinitive of the main verb that are more
commonly used, rather than the inflected form of the main verb
itself.&nbsp; In the third person singular it is of course only
distinguishable from the impersonal form by the position of the
subject, which in the inflected form would follow the verb.&nbsp;
The inflectional form of the third person plural is only used
when the pronoun &ldquo;they&rdquo; is the subject.&nbsp; When
the subject is a plural noun the verb is always in the
singular.&nbsp; The inflected form, either of the auxiliary
<i>gw&icirc;l</i> with the infinitive of the main verb, or of the
main verb itself, is always used for the imperative.&nbsp; In
late <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Cornish, except in the case of
answers for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and of the
peculiar forms of the first, second, and third persons singular
in <i>ma</i>, <i>ta</i>, and <i>va</i>, the subject personal
pronoun is almost always expressed, except, of course, when the
subject is a noun.</p>
<h4>&sect; 2.&nbsp; Negative and Interrogative Sentences<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>For a negative sentence it is never correct to use the
impersonal, but always the inflected form of the verb or of the
auxiliary, preceded by the negative particle <i>ni</i> (older,
<i>ny</i>) or <i>nyns</i>.&nbsp; The order is:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Negative
Particle&mdash;Verb&mdash;Subject&mdash;Complement of
Predicate.</p>
<p>Or:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Negative Particle&mdash;Auxiliary
(inflected)&mdash;Subject&mdash;Infinitive of Main
Verb&mdash;Complement.</p>
<p>If the object is a pronoun, in the first case it follows the
negative particle in its third form, in the second case it
precedes the infinitive in the possessive form.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; <i>Ni welav v&icirc; an
d&ecirc;n</i>, I do not see the man.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ni w&ocirc;r d&ecirc;n v&icirc;th an
&ecirc;r</i>, no man knoweth the hour.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; <i>Ni wr&iacute;gav v&icirc; gwelas
an d&ecirc;n</i>, I did not see the man.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; <i>Ni&rsquo;th welav v&icirc;</i>,
I do not see thee.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; <i>Ni wrigav v&icirc; dha
welas</i>, I did not see thee.</p>
<p>In the case of the present and imperfect of <i>bos</i>, to be,
the particle <i>nyns</i> is often used, and it is sometimes found
with other words beginning with vowels, but its use is rare in
late Cornish, and <i>ni</i>, or less correctly <i>na</i> (or
<i>nag</i> before a vowel) is more usual.</p>
<p>It is allowable to use the inflected form with the
subject-pronoun preceding the negative particle, but it should
only be used for emphasis on the subject, and is better
avoided.</p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>Interrogative sentences are formed with the
interrogative particle <i>a</i>, or by the use of some
interrogative pronoun or adverb.&nbsp; In all cases the inflected
form of the main verb or auxiliary (usually the latter) follows
the particle, pronoun, or adverb, and usually with its initial in
the second state.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A wr&icirc;gough why besca
gwelas</i>?&nbsp; Did you ever see?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A wreugh why agan gwelas</i>?&nbsp; Do
you see us?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Fatla wreugh why cr&#375;a
hedna</i>?&nbsp; How do you call that?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Fraga wreugh why gw&icirc;l
hebma</i>?&nbsp; Why do you do this?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A vednough why m&ocirc;s genev
v&icirc;</i>?&nbsp; Will you go with me?</p>
<p>The particle <i>a</i> is often omitted colloquially, but its
effect is perceptible in the change of the initial of the
verb.&nbsp; If the verb begins with a vowel, <i>a</i> is always
omitted.</p>
<p>With interrogative sentences should come the answers to
them.&nbsp; It must be understood that by nature no Celt can ever
say a plain &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
are &ldquo;dictionary words&rdquo; for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;no&rdquo; in Welsh and Cornish, and they are used a very
little in translations from other languages; but they do not
&ldquo;belong&rdquo; to be used in speaking or writing Welsh or
Cornish.&nbsp; In Gaelic there are not even &ldquo;dictionary
words&rdquo; for them.&nbsp; In Breton <i>ia</i> and <i>nan</i>
are used freely for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no,&rdquo; as in
French, but that is probably quite modern French influence.&nbsp;
The Celtic practice is to repeat the inflected verb of the
question, affirmatively or negatively, in the necessary
person.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&rsquo;Ellough why cowsa
Kern&ucirc;ak</i>?&nbsp; Can you speak Cornish?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gellam</i> or <i>m&icirc;
ellam</i>.&nbsp; I can (yes).&nbsp; <i>Ni ellam</i>, or (less
correctly) <i>nag ellam</i>, I cannot (no).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span><i>A vednough why d&ocirc;s genev
v&icirc;</i>?&nbsp; Will you come with me?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Mednav</i>.&nbsp; I will (yes).&nbsp;
<i>Ni vednav</i>.&nbsp; I will not (no).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>A wr&icirc;g ev m&ocirc;s dh&ocirc;
Benzans</i>?&nbsp; Did he go to Penzance?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwr&icirc;g</i>.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp;
<i>Ni wr&icirc;g</i>.&nbsp; He did not.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>&rsquo;Esta aj&#375;</i>?&nbsp; Art thou
at home?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Thoma</i>.&nbsp; I am.&nbsp;
<i>Nynsov</i>, or <i>nynsoma</i>, or (less correctly), <i>nag
ov</i>.&nbsp; I am not.</p>
<p>In the case of a negative interrogative sentence the verb is
immediately preceded by <i>na</i>=<i>n&icirc;</i> + <i>a</i>,
whether it begins the sentence or is itself preceded by an
interrogative conjunction.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Na wr&icirc;sta gwelas</i>?&nbsp; Didst
thou not see?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Fraga na wr&icirc;sta crejy</i>?&nbsp;
Why didst thou not believe?</p>
<h4>&sect; 3.&nbsp; Dependent Sentences or Subordinate
Clauses<span class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>These are of three kinds:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Those introduced by conjunctions,
such as <i>if</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>as</i>, etc., or by a relative
pronoun.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Those analogous to the
&ldquo;accusative with the infinitive&rdquo; of Latin.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; The absolute clause.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The ordinary dependent clause introduced by a
conjunction has its verb in the indicative, unless the so-called
subjunctive is required to express uncertainty or contingency,
without reference to any preceding conjunction.&nbsp; The verb is
always in the simple inflected or inflected auxiliary form.&nbsp;
The verb which follows the conjunction <i>mar</i> or <i>mara</i>,
if, has its initial in the fourth state, and <i>tre</i>,
<i>tro</i>, or <i>dro</i>, that, governs the second state.</p>
<p>A dependent sentence may sometimes precede its principal
sentence, as in English.&nbsp; A very good instance <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>of
two sorts of dependent clauses may be seen in the following
sentence from Boson&rsquo;s <i>Nebbaz Gerriau</i>.&nbsp; The
English is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If that learned wise man [John Keigwin]
should see this [i.e. this essay], he would find reason to
correct it in orthography, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boson&rsquo;s Cornish, the spelling and division of words
assimilated to that of the present grammar, is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Mar qwressa an d&ecirc;n deskes f&icirc;r-na
gwelas hemma</i>,<br />
If should [do] that man learned wise see this,<br />
<i>ev a venja cavos fraga e ewna en
scr&icirc;fa-composter</i>.<br />
he would find why it to amend in writing-correctness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sentence <i>qwressa</i> is for <i>gwressa</i> (third
person singular of the conditional or pluperfect of the auxiliary
<i>gw&icirc;l</i>, to do), with the initial in its fourth state
after <i>mar</i>.&nbsp; Boson writes it <i>markressa</i>, all in
one word.&nbsp; <i>Fraga e ewna</i> is an example of a variant of
the second form of dependent sentence.&nbsp; The principal verb
<i>ev a venja cavos</i> is in the impersonal auxiliary form, and
of the two dependent clause verbs, one, <i>qwressa an d&ecirc;n
deskes f&icirc;r-na gwelas</i>, is in the inflected auxiliary
form, and the other, <i>ewna</i>, is infinitive.</p>
<p>In a relative sentence, if the relative pronoun is the
subject, the verb appears to be in the impersonal form.&nbsp;
That is to say, it is always in the form of the third person
singular, and does not show any agreement with its antecedent,
whatever person or number that may be in.&nbsp; The other
peculiarities of relative sentences are given in Chapter VII.
&sect;4.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead of using the conjunction <i>that</i>
with another verb in the indicative mood, as in most European
languages, it is usual to put the second verb in the infinitive
preceded by the personal pronoun, as <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>is common
in Latin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus says Norris, speaking in a manner
perhaps rather less clear than usual, of an idiom found in the
Dramas.&nbsp; This idiom, analogous to the &ldquo;accusative with
the infinitive&rdquo; of Latin, is found down to the latest
period of Cornish literature, though not to the complete
exclusion of a finite clause beginning with <i>that</i>.&nbsp;
The instances given by Norris are:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ha cous ef dhe dhasserhy</i>, and say
that he is risen.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Marth a&rsquo;m bues ty dhe leverel
folneth</i>, I have wonder that thou shouldst speak folly.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Nyns a y&rsquo;m colon why dhe
gewsel</i>, it goes not into my heart (i.e. I do not believe)
that you have spoken.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Del won dhe bos</i>, as I know thee to
be.</p>
<p>Here are some later instances:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ny a wel an t&icirc;s younk dho e clappya
leh ha leh</i>, <a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a> we see that the young people speak it
less and less (<i>Nebbaz Gerriau</i>).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dre wrama crejy hedna dho bos gw&icirc;r
yu ser&icirc;fes enna</i>,  that I do believe
that that is true that is written therein (<i>Nebbaz
Gerriau</i>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one finds in the same piece:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ev a lavarras drova gever &#466;l</i>,
 he said that it was Goats All.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Bes m&icirc; a or hemma</i>, <i>dhort e
hoer an Kernuak</i>, <i>drova talves bes nebbas</i>,  but I know this, by her sister the
Cornish, that it is worth but little.</p>
<p>And in Keigwin&rsquo;s translation of <i>Genesis</i>
i.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ha Dew a wellas trova da</i>,
 and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar construction is sometimes used after
<i>dreven</i>, because, and <i>treba</i>, until:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dreven t&icirc; dh&ocirc; w&icirc;l
hemma</i>,  because thou hast done this
(Kerew&rsquo;s <i>Genesis</i>, iii. 14).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span><i>Dreven t&icirc; dh&ocirc;
wolsowas dh&ocirc; dalla dha wr&ecirc;g</i>, <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a> because thou didst listen to the voice
of thy wife (<i>Gen</i>. iii. 17).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Treba t&icirc; dh&ocirc; draylya
dh&ocirc;&rsquo;n n&ocirc;r</i>,  until thou turn
again to the earth (<i>Gen</i>. iii. 19).</p>
<p>Yet even there one finds</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dreven o hy dama a &#335;l bewa</i>,
because she was the mother of all
living (<i>Gen</i>. iii. 20).</p>
<p>Lhuyd mentions a similar construction after <i>rag own</i>,
for fear, lest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Rag own wh&#375; dho g&ocirc;dha po an
rew dho derry ha wh&#375; dho vos bidhes</i>,  lest you fall or the ice break and you
be drowned (literally, for fear you to fall or the ice to break
and you to be drowned).</p>
<p>With <i>fraga</i>, why, one finds a similar form:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ev a venja cavos fraga e ewna</i>, he
would find why to amend it.</p>
<p>But when <i>fraga</i> introduces an interrogative sentence, an
ordinary finite verb is used:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Fraga</i> (or <i>rag fraga</i>,
&ldquo;for why,&rdquo;) <i>na grejeth dh&ocirc;&rsquo; m
lavarow</i>?&nbsp; Why dost thou not believe my words?</p>
<p>When &ldquo;that&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;in order that,&rdquo;
the ordinary finite verb is used after it.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar construction, found chiefly in
Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>, but also in the <i>Ordinalia</i>
(e.g. <i>Pass. Chr.</i> 1120), for expressing &ldquo;that I
am.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists of the infinitive <i>bos</i>, to be,
preceded by a possessive pronoun and followed by a pronominal
suffix:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Me a vyn mav fo gwellys</i> ow bosaf
<i>Dew heb parow</i>, I will that it may be seen, that I am God
without equals.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>And a still more confused one of the second person with
the verbal particle <i>y</i> before <i>bos</i>, the pronominal
suffix <i>ta</i> and the pronoun
<i>ge</i>=<i>d&icirc;</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Me ny allaf convethas</i>, y bosta ge
<i>ow hendas</i>, I cannot understand that thou art my
ancestor.</p>
<p>The first is analogous to the Welsh &ldquo;infinitive
construction,&rdquo; as Rowland calls it, e.g. <i>gwyr</i> fy mod
i <i>yn dyfod</i>, he knows that I am coming (lit. he knows my
being in coming), only the Cornish form uses the pronominal
suffix instead of the redundant personal pronoun.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Absolute Clause.&nbsp; This construction, which
answers more or less to the ablative absolute of Latin, and the
genitive absolute of Greek, is common to all the Celtic
languages.&nbsp; It is translated into English by a sentence
introduced by <i>when</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>whilst</i>, or
<i>though</i>, with a verb generally in the continuous form of
the present or past tense, or by a participle.&nbsp; In the
Celtic languages the absolute clause has two forms.</p>
<p><i>a</i>.&nbsp; The affirmative, generally consisting of the
conjunction <i>and</i>, a subject, noun or pronoun, and generally
a participle.&nbsp; Rowland calls the conjunction, <i>a</i>,
<i>ac</i>, of the Welsh form &ldquo;the absolute particle,&rdquo;
and Professor Anwyl identifies it with <i>a</i>, <i>ag</i>, with,
in an archaic form.&nbsp; But in Cornish <i>ha</i> or <i>hag</i>
is used, and in Gaelic <i>agus</i>, and, in exactly the same
way.&nbsp; The following are examples in Cornish, Welsh, and
Gaelic:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Cornish.&nbsp; <i>An jy a ve gwarnes gan
Dew</i>, <i>ha &rsquo;n jy ow cusca</i>, <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> they were warned by God, and they

<i>St. Matth.</i> ii. 12, Gwav. MS.).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>El a&rsquo;n leverys dethy haneth</i>,
<i>ha hy yn gwely pur thyfun</i>, an angel said it to her this

the man, and he coming home, i.e. when he was coming home.</p>
<p><i>b</i>.&nbsp; The negative, in which <i>not</i> is expressed
in Welsh and Cornish by <i>heb</i>, and in Gaelic by <i>gan</i>,
both meaning <i>without</i>, followed by an
infinitive:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An delna ema stel ow tegy warnodha</i>,
<i>heb wara dhodha teller v&icirc;th</i>, <a
name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a> so it is still closing in upon it
without leaving it any place (Boson&rsquo;s <i>Nebbaz
Gerriau</i>).</p>
<p>In many such cases this negative clause can be translated
literally into English, and it is the usual form of negation with
an infinitive or present participle.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar absolute clause of a descriptive character
occurs occasionally:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>An golom</i>, <i>glas hy lagas</i>, <i>yn
mes gura hy delyfre</i>, the dove, blue her eyes, do set her free
(<i>Origo Mundi</i>, 1105-6).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Un flogh yonk</i>, <i>gwyn y dhyllas</i>,
a young child, white his raiment (<i>Passion</i>, 254, 3).</p>
<p>In a similar construction in Welsh the adjective here agrees
with the first noun, and the translation would be rather
&ldquo;The dove blue [as to] her eyes,&rdquo; but in Cornish this
is not so, for in this sentence <i>golom</i> (second state of
<i>colom</i>) is feminine, so that the adjective would be
<i>las</i>, not <i>glas</i>, if it agreed with it.</p>
<h4><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>&sect; 4.&nbsp; The Infinitive or
Verbal Noun<span class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>The infinitive of a verb is treated almost exactly like a
noun.&nbsp; If its object is a pronoun, this precedes the
infinitive in the possessive form and governs its initial as it
would that of a noun.&nbsp; If the object is not a pronoun, it
follows the infinitive without change of initial, after the
manner of an appositional genitive.</p>
<p>Very often the infinitive is governed by <i>dh&ocirc;</i>, to,
as in English, and under much the same circumstances, except that
it is not so governed when it comes as the subject of another
verb, and of course <i>dh&ocirc;</i> is not used after auxiliary
verbs.&nbsp; It is especially used after verbs implying
motion.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a vedn m&ocirc;s dh&ocirc;
&rsquo;gas gwelas</i>, I will go to see you.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; eth dh&ocirc; vetya an
tr&ecirc;n</i>, I went to meet the train.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Lowen on ny dh&ocirc; &rsquo;gas gwelas
why</i>, we are glad to see you.</p>
<p>When the sense of &ldquo;to&rdquo; is &ldquo;in order
to,&rdquo; or the preceding verb implies an intention, the
infinitive is generally preceded by <i>rag</i> or <i>rag
dh&ocirc;</i>, &ldquo;for to,&rdquo; or by <i>a dh&ocirc;</i>,
&ldquo;of to.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>&sect; 5.&nbsp; Some Idioms and Expressions<span
class="smcap">.</span></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>To have</i> is expressed in three ways.</p>
<p><i>a</i>.&nbsp; By the verb <i>bos</i>, to be, with the thing
possessed as subject and the possessor in the dative form, i.e.
preceded by <i>dh&ocirc;</i>, to; cf. <i>est mihi</i> in
Latin.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Affirmative.&nbsp; <i>Ema levar dhem</i>,
there is a book to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Negative.&nbsp; <i>Nynsyu levar dhem</i>,
there is not a book to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Interrog.&nbsp; <i>&rsquo;Es levar
dhem</i>?&nbsp; Is there a book to me?</p>
<p>This is the common form in late Cornish.</p>
<p><i>b</i>.&nbsp; By the verb <i>cafos</i> or <i>cavos</i>, to
find, to obtain, used as an ordinary transitive verb with the
possessor as <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>subject and the thing possessed as
object.&nbsp; This is not used for the present tense.&nbsp; Lhuyd
gives a past tense, <i>m&icirc; a gavaz</i> or <i>m&icirc;
&rsquo;rig gavaz</i>, I had, and a future, <i>m&icirc; ven
gavaz</i>, I will have, but he, Norris, and Williams are all
inclined to confuse this with the third form.</p>
<p><i>c</i>.&nbsp; By a peculiar idiom compounded of a form of
the verb <i>bos</i>, to be, and the third form of the personal
(or else the possessive) pronouns.&nbsp; The explanation, as far
as it goes, of this verb is to be found in Breton.&nbsp; Even
there it has been confused a good deal, though its use is plain
enough.&nbsp; Legonidec calls it &ldquo;le verbe <i>kaout</i>
[=Cornish <i>cavos</i>], avoir,&rdquo; which he distinguishes
from <i>kavout</i> or <i>kaout</i>, trouver; Maunoir, whose
Breton, according to a picture in Quimper Cathedral, was received
miraculously from an angel, wisely does not commit himself, but
calls the verb, Latin fashion, after the first person singular of
the present.&nbsp; Prof. Loth rightly speaks of it as &ldquo;le
verbe dit avoir,&rdquo; and M. Ernault calls it &ldquo;Verbe
<i>beza</i> [to be] au sens de &lsquo;avoir,&rsquo;&rdquo; and he
explains it to be the verb <i>to be</i>, combined with the
&ldquo;pronoms r&eacute;gimes,&rdquo; which is just what it
is.&nbsp; In Breton it is not only used as the ordinary verb
<i>to have</i>=to possess, but also as an auxiliary verb in the
same manner as <i>avoir</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>haben</i>, are used
in French, English, and German.&nbsp; This verb came to be used
in Breton with or without the nominative pronoun being
expressed.&nbsp; In Cornish the expressed nominative pronoun is
less usual, except in the second person singular, where it is the
rule.&nbsp; That it should be used at all in either language is a
sign that in practice the original formation of the verb has been
forgotten.&nbsp; Occasionally in Cornish this oblivion has
resulted even in the application of pronominal inflections to the
verb.</p>
<p>This form is found frequently in the <i>Ordinalia</i> and in
the <i>Poem of the Passion</i>; it is fairly common in the
<i>Life of St. Meriasek</i>, it is rarer in the <i>Creation</i>,
and <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>is not found at all in Cornish of
the latest period (except in a doubtful and muddled form in
Keigwin&rsquo;s version of the Commandments), though Lhuyd gives
a fragment of it in his Grammar, evidently taken from the earlier
Dramas and not from oral tradition, for he takes the <i>g</i> of
<i>geffi</i> and <i>gefyth</i> to be a hard <i>g</i>, whereas it
is plainly a soft <i>g</i> for a <i>d</i>, as the analogy of
<i>tevyth</i>, and of the Breton <i>deveuz</i>, <i>devez</i>,
etc., shows.&nbsp; Moreover, it is sometimes written
<i>ieves</i>, which is intended to represent <i>jeves</i>.</p>
<p>It will be well, by way of making this form clearer, to give
not only the Cornish but also the corresponding Breton.</p>

<p>This tense is formed on <i>us</i>, <i>eus</i>, <i>es</i>
(Breton <i>euz</i>), one of the forms of the third person
singular of the verb substantive.&nbsp; To this is prefixed the
verbal particle <i>a</i>, with the letter which is the third form
of the personal pronoun, <i>&rsquo;m</i>, <i>&rsquo;th</i>,
<i>&rsquo;n</i>, <i>&rsquo;s</i>, <i>&rsquo;n</i>,
<i>&rsquo;s</i>, <i>&rsquo;s</i>, with the peculiar addition of
<i>jev</i> and <i>tev</i> to the third persons and <i>b</i> to
the others.&nbsp; The <i>&rsquo;th</i> of the second person
singular is found written in this but not always in the other
tenses, for it was probably often silent before <i>f</i> by a
sort of assimilation.&nbsp; Its effect is observable in the
initial mutation.&nbsp; Of this tense the first, second, and
third persons singular <!-- page 171--><a

second person plural are found.&nbsp; But for the existence of
the form <i>as bes</i> [<i>bues</i>] for the last, one might
suppose, with Williams, that the <i>b</i> of <i>am bes</i> was
only the addition of a cognate letter to the <i>m</i>.&nbsp; But

<p>In this tense the Breton does not use the nominative personal
pronoun, except when it is a form of the future, but prefixes
<i>r&rsquo;</i> (<i>ra</i>).&nbsp; In Cornish <i>re</i> is used
to make the optative and perfect, and in this case the
<i>&rsquo;th</i> of the second person singular is not omitted,
for <i>re&rsquo; th fo</i> and <i>re &rsquo;th f&ecirc;</i> are
the forms found.</p>
<p>A rather doubtful second tense (secondary present or
imperfect), equivalent to the Breton <i>am boa</i>, may be
conjectured in <i>am beua</i> (<i>St. Mer.</i> 47, 1686), <i>am
bethe</i> may be the equivalent of the Breton imperfect
subjunctive, <i>am bize</i>, <i>bije</i>, <i>befe</i>, and the
third person singular of this may be the <i>an geffa</i> of
<i>St. Mer.</i> 20, 159.&nbsp; Dr. Whitley Stokes gives both
these forms as secondary presents.&nbsp; There is also a possible
pluperfect <i>te ny vea</i>, and <i>nyn gyfye</i>, found in the
second and third persons singular.</p>
<p>One finds such forms as <i>am buef</i>, <i>as bethough</i>,
<i>may &rsquo;stefons</i>, etc., as instances of pronominal
inflections added to this verb, showing how completely its
derivation was forgotten, and it is further confused by being
perhaps mixed up with the verb <i>pewa</i> (Welsh <i>piau</i>,
Breton <i>piaoua</i>), to possess, a verb which in all three
languages requires rather more disentangling than it has as yet
received.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>There are very full examples of this verb in
Zeuss&rsquo;s <i>Grammatica Celtica</i> (ed. 1871, p. 565).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Besides <i>to have</i>, certain other verbs are
expressed with <i>bos</i> and the preposition
<i>dh&ocirc;</i>.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma cov dhem</i> [pron. <i>ma
c&oacute;dhem</i>], I remember, lit. there is remembrance to
me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma whans dhem</i>, I want, lit. there is
want to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma wh&ecirc;r dhem</i>, I am sorry, lit.
there is grief to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma own dhem</i>, I fear, lit. there is
fear to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma dout dhem</i>, I doubt, lit. there is
doubt to me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ma reys dhem</i>, or <i>reys yw dhem</i>,
I must, lit. there is need to me.</p>
<p>Another expression for &ldquo;to remember&rdquo; is <i>perthy
cov</i>, to bear memory.&nbsp; The imperative was sometimes
written <i>perco</i> in one word.&nbsp; <i>Perthy</i> is used
similarly with other nouns: <i>na berth medh</i>, be not ashamed,
<i>na berth own</i>, be not afraid, <i>na berth wh&ecirc;r</i>,
be not sorry, <i>an vuscogyon orto a borthas avy</i>, the fools
hated him (<i>Passion</i>, 26, 3), <i>na berth dout</i>, do not
doubt.&nbsp; The literal meaning is to bear shame, fear, sorrow,
envy, doubt, etc.</p>
<p>Similarly nouns and adjectives are used with <i>gan</i>, with,
as in Welsh, to represent states of mind.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Da yu genev</i>, I like, lit. it is good
with me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Dr&ocirc;g yu genev</i>, I am sorry, lit.
it is bad with me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwell yu genev</i>, I prefer, lit. it is
better with me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Marth yu genev</i>, I am astonished, lit.
wonder is with me.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Cas yu genev</i>, I hate, lit. hate is
with me.</p>
<p>The verbs <i>dal</i> and <i>goth</i>, signifying <i>ought</i>,
<i>it behoves</i>, are used either impersonally or, though this
is a late corruption, as ordinary verbs.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Ni dal dhen ny</i> / <i>Ni goth dhen
ny</i> } we ought not.</p>
<p>Or:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>M&icirc; a dal</i> / <i>M&icirc; a
goth</i> } I ought.</p>

174</span>3.&nbsp; <i>Gwyn an b&ecirc;s</i>.&nbsp; This poetical
expression is common to Cornish, Welsh, and Breton.&nbsp; It
signifies, &ldquo;fair the world,&rdquo; i.e. happy, and is used
with possessive pronouns and appositional genitives.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwyn ow b&ecirc;s</i>, fair my world,
happy I.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwyn dha v&ecirc;s</i>, happy thou.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwyn e v&ecirc;s</i>, happy he.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Gwyn b&ecirc;s an den na wr&icirc;g
cerdhes en c&#335;s&#335;l an gamhin-segyon</i>, blessed is the
man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly.</p>
<p>In Welsh, when the possessor of this &ldquo;fair world&rdquo;
is expressed by a noun, there is a redundant possessive pronoun
before <i>byd</i> (<i>b&ecirc;s</i>).&nbsp; Thus Psalm i. begins
<i>Gwyn ei fyd y gwr</i>, fair his world of the man.&nbsp; But
this is not the Cornish form, which uses the simple appositional
genitive in such cases.&nbsp; There is a contrary expression,
<i>dr&ocirc;g p&ecirc;s</i>, found in the <i>Ordinalia</i>
(<i>Passio Christi</i>, 3089), <i>drok pys of</i>, unhappy am
I.&nbsp; In this case <i>dr&ocirc;g</i> seems to put the initial
of <i>b&ecirc;s</i> in its fourth state.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The following phrases are in common use, and are
generally run into one or two words in pronunciation.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <i>The Second State</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>a</i>.&nbsp; <i>A feminine singular</i>
or <i>masculine plural</i> noun (or adjective used as a noun)
preceded by the definite article <i>an</i>, the, or the numeral
<i>idn</i>, one, has its initial in the second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>b</i>.&nbsp; An adjective which follows
and qualifies a <i>feminine singular</i> noun, has its initial in
the second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>c</i>.&nbsp; A noun preceded by an
adjective qualifying it, of whatever gender or number, has its
initial in the second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d</i>.&nbsp; If the adjective preceding
and qualifying a <i>feminine singular</i> noun follows the
article <i>an</i>, the, the initial of the adjective is also in
the second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>e</i>.&nbsp; A noun in the vocative
preceded by the particle <i>a</i>, O (expressed or omitted for
the sake of verse), has its initial in the second state.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>f</i>.&nbsp; The possessive pronouns
<i>dha</i>, thy, and <i>e</i>, his, are followed by words,
whether nouns, adjectives, or verbal nouns (infinitives) in the

generally puts the word which follows in the second state, but
sometimes in the fourth, or changes <i>b</i> to <i>f</i>, not
<i>v</i>.</p>

are the general principles of them.&nbsp; There are valuable
notes on their phonetic principles in Dr. Whitley Stokes&rsquo;s
notes to <i>St. Meriasek</i>, and in a paper of additional notes
which he published later.&nbsp; In the latest Cornish there was a
tendency to use the second state after nearly anything,
especially prepositions, except the few words which govern the
other two mutations.</p>
<h3><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>CHAPTER XV&mdash;PROSODY</h3>
<p>The prosody of the Celtic languages is often very elaborate,
but the more modern tendency has generally been in the direction
of assimilating it to the prosody of English, or, in the case of
Breton, to that of French.&nbsp; In Welsh two systems exist at
the present day, and the rules of them are known respectively as
<i>y Rheolau Caethion</i> and <i>y Rheolau Rhyddion</i>, the bond
or strict rules and the free rules.&nbsp; The former are founded
on elaborate rules of <i>Cynghanedd</i> or consonance, which term
includes alliteration and rhyme, and every imaginable
correspondence of consonant and vowel sounds, reduced to a system
which Welsh-speaking Welshmen profess to be able to appreciate,
and no doubt really can, though it is not easily understood by
the rest of the world.&nbsp; The rules of <i>Cynghanedd</i> are
applied in various ways to the four-and-twenty metres of the
Venedotian (Gwynedd or North Wales) school, and to the metres of
the Dimetian (Dyfed or South-West Wales) and the Glamorgan
schools.&nbsp; Modern Welsh bards, however, though they often use
the strict rules as <i>tours-de-force</i> for Eisteddfod
purposes, as often compose poetry according to the free rules,
which are mostly the ordinary go-as-you-please metres of the
Saxon.&nbsp; The Bretons follow the ordinary French rules as to
the strict number of syllables, the c&aelig;sura, and the
rhyming, taking very little account of the stress accent either
of words or sentences.</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>The prosody of the older Cornish literature has little
in common with the strict system of Welsh.&nbsp; Though one does
find alliterations and &ldquo;internal&rdquo; rhyming and
correspondence of consonants, they do not seem to be at all
systematic, but are only either introduced as casual ornaments or
purely accidentally.&nbsp; The rules of the older Cornish prosody
have more in common with those of Breton, except that, but for
one case in the Dramas of a five-syllabled couplet, and the
rather irregular Add. Charter fragment in the British Museum,
there are only two lengths of lines, seven or four syllables, and
the c&aelig;sura is not very definite.</p>
<p>The seven-syllabled lines are the more common.&nbsp; The whole
of the <i>Poem of the Passion</i> is in stanzas of eight
seven-syllabled lines, rhyming alternately, but written as
fourteen-syllabled lines; and the greater part of the Dramas is
in lines of the same length, though with varying arrangements of
rhymes.&nbsp; Sometimes whole passages of four-syllabled lines
occur, and frequently four-syllabled lines occur in the same
stanza with those of seven syllables.&nbsp; The rhythmic accent
seems to be trochaic, and the heptasyllabic line to consist of
three trochees and a long syllable, but as the stress accent of
words is absolutely disregarded, and the strong beats of the
rhythm sometimes fall on monosyllables which out of poetry would
probably be enclitic or proclitic, or at any rate very slightly
accented, one can only be sure of the fact that the poet of the
<i>Ordinalia</i> was careful to count his syllables exactly, and
to make the last syllable of every line rhyme with the last
syllable of some other line.&nbsp; The author of the <i>Poem of
the Passion</i> was not quite so careful, and Jordan was still
less so.&nbsp; Diphthongs, as in Breton, are occasionally counted
as two syllables, a <i>y</i> followed by another vowel is
sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, and there are
occasional elisions and perhaps contractions, <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>understood
but not expressed, <a name="citation180a"></a><a
href="#footnote180a" class="citation">[180a]</a> but with these
few exceptions the number of syllables to a line is strictly
accurate, and in the <i>Ordinalia</i> is never varied by the
unaccented and uncounted syllables that often occur in English
verse.&nbsp; The rhymes are quite strict to the eye, but that is
no doubt because in the days when one could spell as one pleased,
the writer might arrange his spelling to suit, but there appear
to be cases where the <i>dh</i> and <i>th</i>, both written
<i>th</i>, as final consonants are made to rhyme together, and
the three sounds of <i>u</i> (<i>oo</i> and the French <i>u</i>
and <i>eu</i>) are sometimes confused.&nbsp; Though the rhymes
are always &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; (i.e. of one syllable), there
are occasionally cases where, unless one counts the rhymes as
&ldquo;feminine&rdquo; (i.e. of two syllables), they would not be
rhymes at all, and yet feminine rhymes would throw out the
rhythm. <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"
class="citation">[180b]</a></p>
<p>The metres of late Cornish were usually rather more
assimilated to English, but apparently some memory of Celtic
prosody lingered on.&nbsp; Lhuyd quotes a proverb, of which he
gives two versions, in the old three-lined metre known in Welsh
as the <i>Triban Milwr</i>, or Warrior&rsquo;s Triplets, which is
found as early as Llywarch Hen&rsquo;s Laments for Geraint ap
Erbyn and for the Death of Cynddylan, in the sixth century.&nbsp;
Lhuyd himself wrote a Cornish Lament for William of Orange in
what he claimed as the same metre, a singularly inappropriate
subject for the language of a nation of loyal Jacobites, as the
Cornish certainly were as late as 1715.&nbsp; Boson (Gwavas MS.,
f. 7) wrote a short elegy on James Jenkins <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>of
Alverton, also in rhyming triplets.&nbsp; The curious little
song, which is all that remains of Jenkins&rsquo;s poetry, seems
to show indications of a feeling for internal rhymes and
something like a rudimentary <i>Cynghanedd</i>, but there is not
enough of it to reduce to any definite rules.&nbsp; Even in
Boson&rsquo;s verses and in those of Gwavas and Tonkin of St.
Just (not the historian), in the Gwavas MS., the old system of
counting syllables and taking very little account of the stress
accents of words, is occasionally found, but generally in the
later verse the extra unaccented syllables freely introduced show
that a sense of accent and beats of rhythm had come in.</p>

five-syllabled throughout, except that a &ldquo;feminine&rdquo;
or double rhyme is occasionally allowable (e.g.
<i>powes-mowes</i>), and that the light first syllable of a line
may be omitted.&nbsp; This accounts for the two six-syllabled and
two four-syllabled lines respectively.&nbsp; In the rest of the

consists of stanzas of eight lines of seven syllables, rhyming

<p>It is evident that by varying the number of lines and rhymes
to a stanza, varying the distribution of the rhymes, and mixing
lines of different length, an almost <!-- page 187--><a

variety may be obtained, even with only two forms of line.</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; The metres of Jordan&rsquo;s Drama of <i>The
Creation</i> (1611) do not differ materially in intention from
those of the <i>Ordinalia</i>, on which they are evidently
modelled.&nbsp; But in this play one begins to find signs of a
tendency to a less accurate ear for exact syllabic rhythm.&nbsp;
About eighty lines out of the 2548 of which the play consists
have eight syllables, about twenty have only six, and in each
case these ought to be seven-syllabled.&nbsp; Also there are two
cases of three and six of five syllables in what ought to be
four-syllabled lines, and there are several cases of nine
syllables in a line, and one case of ten.&nbsp; No doubt some of
these discrepancies may be accounted for by elisions and
contractions not expressed in writing (as is often the case in
Latin), and some of the short lines contain diphthongs which may
be meant to count as two syllables, but by no means all are
explainable by anything but the influence of English, or, as is
less probable, a reversion to some such archaic idea of rhythm as
that of the Add. Charter fragment.</p>
<p>After this we come to the verses of late Cornish.&nbsp; These
are few, poor, corrupt, and illiterate, and for the most part
without value for metrical purposes.&nbsp; The strictly syllabic
metres of the older Cornish have nearly disappeared, and though
the tonic accent is still disregarded when convenient, extra
unaccented syllables, as often in inferior, and sometimes in good
English verse, are freely introduced by way of anacrusis, etc.,
in a manner that shows that accent was considered in a sort of
way, and that the accents of a line rather than the syllables
were counted.&nbsp; John Boson wrote a few lines in three-lined
stanzas somewhat after the fashion of the Welsh <i>Triban
Milwr</i>, and Lhuyd&rsquo;s artificial elegy on William of
Orange is another instance of the same.&nbsp; <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>The only
poem remaining of James Jenkins of Alverton (printed by Pryce and
Davies Gilbert) is a sort of irregular ode, which refuses to be
satisfactorily analysed.&nbsp; The lines are all sorts of
lengths, they may begin with an accent or they may have one or
two light syllables before the first strong beat, the rhymes may
be single or double.&nbsp; The principle of the first part seems
to be little lines of two beats, varying from three to seven
syllables rhyming in couplets.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The epigrams printed by Pryce and Davies Gilbert were mostly
composed by Boson and Gwavas.&nbsp; Eight-syllabled lines are
frequent among them, but they are of little or no value, and are
altogether on English models, and not very good models at
that.</p>
<p>Should any one wish to attempt verse-writing in Cornish, it
would be best either to use one of the seven <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>or four
syllabled (or mixed) metres of the Dramas, using their purely
syllabic methods, which undoubtedly work all right in modern
Breton, or to extend the same principles, as the Bretons do, to
lines of other lengths.&nbsp; The triplets of old Welsh and
perhaps of very old Cornish are effective metres, but are not so
easy as they look, for it is not enough merely to write rhyming
triplets.&nbsp; Lhuyd in his one attempt has produced a peculiar
though allowable metre, with lines of all sorts of lengths, and
the old specimens, Llywarch Hen&rsquo;s <i>Marwnad Geraint ap
Erbin</i>, and the Englynion called <i>Eiry Mynydd</i>, are
largely in lines of seven syllables, and some of them, such as
the Song of the Death of Cynddylan, and the curious ninth-century
poem in the Cambridge <i>Juvencus</i>, seem to have also the
<i>gair cyrch</i>, that strange little tag to the first line of
the triplet, outside of the rhyme but not outside of the
assonance or alliteration, which is so marked a characteristic of
the four-lined Englyn, while in most of them there are
alliterations, vowel correspondences, and internal rhymes, which
are not so haphazard as they look.&nbsp; It is well not to
attempt to force a Celtic language into a Teutonic mould.&nbsp;
Some of the most beautiful metres that the world has ever known
are to be found among the works of English poets, but they are no
more suitable to Cornish than hexameters, sapphics, and alcaics
on strict quantity lines would be to English.&nbsp; It is
possible, however, to write ten-syllabled blank verse in Cornish,
provided a fair amount of alliteration is used.</p>
<p>One word about inversions of the order of words in
poetry.&nbsp; This should be done very sparingly, and it is not
easy to lay down very definite rules as to what is allowable and
what not.&nbsp; It is best not to deviate from the usual order of
words unless one can find a precedent in one of the Dramas.&nbsp;
Some inversions, however, are quite allowable.&nbsp; Thus one may
put the complement of <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>a predicate, e.g. an infinitive, an
accusative, or a participle, at the beginning of a
phrase:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gutindent"><i>mos then menythe me a vyn</i>
(<i>Creation</i>, 1082), go to the mountain I will.</p>
<p>These are all taken from Jordan&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>, and
mostly at random from the same page.&nbsp; Still, the less one
inverts the normal order of words the better.</p>
<h3><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;NOTE ON THE
INTERPRETATION OF CORNISH NAMES</h3>
<p>One of the practical interests in the study of Cornish is in
the interpretation of place-names.&nbsp; As quite ninety per
cent. of the place-names of Cornwall are Celtic, and as a very
large proportion of these are descriptive names, usually in a
fairly uncorrupted state, this gives much opportunity of
research.&nbsp; There are, however, certain considerations,
grammatical and topographical, which should be kept carefully in
mind in attempting to discover the meanings of these names, and
it is a disregard of these considerations that has made most of
the published works on the subject so singularly valueless.&nbsp;
The great majority of Cornish names are composed of epithets
suffixed to certain nouns, such as <i>tre</i>, <i>trev</i>, a
town; <i>pol</i>, a pool; <i>pen</i> or <i>pedn</i>, head or top;
<i>r&ocirc;s</i>, often written <i>rose</i>, a heath; <i>car</i>,
a fort or camp; <i>lan</i>, an enclosure, or a church;
<i>eglos</i>, a church; <i>bal</i>, a mine; <i>wh&ecirc;l</i> or
<i>wheal</i>, a work (<i>i.e.</i> a mine); <i>chy</i>, <i>ty</i>,
a house; <i>park</i>, a field; <i>forth</i>, a creek or harbour;
<i>nans</i>, a valley; <i>carn</i>, a cairn or heap of rocks;
<i>hal</i>, a moor; <i>g&ucirc;n</i>, <i>goon</i>, a down;
<i>gw&ecirc;l</i>, <i>gweal</i>, a field; <i>bod</i>, <i>bos</i>,
<i>be</i>, a dwelling; <i>les</i>, a court, a palace;
<i>carrack</i>, a rock; <i>creeg</i>, a tumulus; <i>crows</i>, a
cross; <i>din</i>, <i>dun</i>, a hill-fort; <i>fenton</i> or
<i>venton</i>, a spring; <i>kelly</i>, <i>killy</i>, a grove;
<i>cos</i>, <i>coose</i>, a wood; <i>m&ecirc;n</i>, a stone;
<i>tol</i>, a hole; <i>triga</i>, <i>trigva</i>, a
dwelling-place; <i>melan</i>, <i>mellan</i>, <i>vellan</i>, a
mill; <i>zawn</i>, <i>zawns</i>, a cove; <i>bron</i>,
<i>bryn</i>, a hill; <i>bar</i>, <i>bor</i>, <i>bur</i>, a
summit; <i>tor</i>, a hill.&nbsp; These <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>are the
commonest of the nouns.&nbsp; The epithets may be:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Adjectives, signifying size,
colour, position, etc., e.g. <i>m&ecirc;r</i>, <i>mear</i>,
<i>vcar</i>, great; <i>b&icirc;an</i>, <i>bean</i>, <i>vean</i>,
little; <i>glas</i>, blue; <i>dew</i>, black; <i>gwin</i>,
<i>gwidu</i>, <i>widn</i>, white; <i>gwartha</i>, <i>wartha</i>,
<i>gwarra</i>, upper; <i>gollas</i>, <i>gullas</i>,
<i>wollas</i>, lower, etc., in agreement with the noun.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Other nouns in the appositional
genitive.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; Proper names.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Adjectives or nouns preceded by the
article <i>an</i>, the, or by a preposition such as <i>war</i>,
on.</p>
<p>The following points should be considered:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The gender of the noun.&nbsp; Of the nouns mentioned
above, <i>tre</i>, <i>ros</i>, <i>car</i>, <i>lan</i>,
<i>wh&ecirc;l</i>, <i>hal</i>, <i>goon</i>, <i>carrack</i>,
<i>crows</i>, <i>fenton</i>, <i>kelly</i>, <i>trigva</i>,
<i>mellan</i>, <i>bron</i>, <i>tor</i>, are feminine, so that the
initial of the adjective epithet is changed to the second
state.&nbsp; This may often, more or less, determine whether the
epithet is an adjective or a noun in the genitive.&nbsp; Thus, in
the name <i>Tremaine</i>, we may be sure that the second syllable
is not an adjective or it would be <i>Trevaine</i>, so the
meaning is not, as one would think, &ldquo;the stone
house,&rdquo; not a very distinguishing epithet in Cornwall, but
probably the &ldquo;house of the stones,&rdquo; i.e. of some
stone circle or other prehistoric remains.&nbsp; Sometimes,
however, the initial of an appositional genitive, and sometimes
that of an epithet of a masculine noun is irregularly changed in
composition.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The stress accent of the compound.&nbsp; This is of
great importance, especially in determining whether an article or
preposition intervenes between the noun and its epithet, and
also, in the rare cases in which it occurs, in deciding whether
the epithet may not precede the noun.&nbsp; <i>The stress accent
is almost invariably on the epithet</i>, and it is astonishing to
see how even in <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>East Cornwall, where the language
has been dead for three centuries, this accentuation is still
preserved.&nbsp; If the epithet suffix is a monosyllable, the
accent of the compounded word is on the last syllable; if not,
the accent is usually on the last but one, but the intervening
article or preposition is always a proclitic, and is disregarded
as to accent.&nbsp; The same sort of thing happens in
English.&nbsp; Thus, even if it were the custom to write
<i>Stratfordonavon</i> all in one word, we should know by the
accent that it meant <i>Stratford-on-Avon</i>; but one, say some
German philologist, who had never heard it pronounced, and knew
nothing of British topography and the distribution of surnames,
might conjecture that it was <i>Stratfor D&oacute;navon</i>,
might compare it with <i>Lydiard Tregoze</i>, <i>Stoke
Dabernon</i>, <i>Sutton Valence</i>, or <i>Compton Wyniates</i>,
and might build thereon a beautiful theory of an Irish settlement
in Warwickshire.&nbsp; Things every whit as absurd as this have
been done with Cornish names.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The position and general features of the place.&nbsp;
Thus when we find that a rather important town is situated at the
innermost point of a bay called in Cornish (cf. Boson&rsquo;s
Pilchard Song) <i>Zans Garrak Loos en K&ucirc;z</i>, we may doubt
whether its name signifies &ldquo;the holy head or
headland,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;the head of the bay.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In this case there is a slight complication, because there is
actually something of a headland about the Battery Rocks, and the
town arms are St. John Baptist&rsquo;s head in a charger; but
when we find that <i>Tremaine</i> is some ten miles, as the crow
flies, from the nearest point of the coast, we may be quite
justified in doubting whether Pryce is right in calling it
&ldquo;the town on shore or sea coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following specimens of names about whose meaning there can
be no doubt, will serve as examples of the construction of
Cornish place-names:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>1.&nbsp; Epithet following noun.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>a</i>.&nbsp; Masculine.&nbsp;
<i>Porthmear</i> (in Zennor), the great porth or creek.&nbsp;
(Murray&rsquo;s Handbook says that it means the
&ldquo;sea-port,&rdquo; but Murray&rsquo;s interpretations are
intricately and ingeniously wrong-headed).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>b</i>.&nbsp; Feminine.&nbsp;
<i>Trevean</i>, the little town.&nbsp; <i>Tre</i> signifies
<i>town</i> in the modern Cornish and old English sense, a
farmhouse with its out-buildings.&nbsp; It is the commonest of
these generic prefixes.&nbsp; In Brittany, though it is
occasionally found, its place is usually taken by <i>Ker</i>
(Cornish <i>Car</i>, Welsh <i>Caer</i>), probably the Latin
<i>castrum</i>, a fortified town or camp, a difference which has
its historical significance.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Epithet preceding noun.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Hendrea</i>, the old town (in
Sancreed).&nbsp; Note that this is <i>H&eacute;ndrea</i>, not
<i>Hendr&eacute;a</i>.&nbsp; Note also the change of initial in
<i>tre</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Intervening particles.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>a</i>.&nbsp; The definite article.&nbsp;
<i>Crows-an-wra</i>, the witch&rsquo;s cross.&nbsp; (Murray says
that it means &ldquo;the wayside cross,&rdquo; but <i>gwragh</i>,
<i>gwrah</i>, <i>gwra</i>, Breton <i>gwrac&rsquo;h</i>, certainly
means a hag or witch, and the change of initial after the article
shows that the noun is feminine.)&nbsp; <i>Chy-an-dowr</i>, the
house of the water.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>b</i>.&nbsp; Preposition.&nbsp;
<i>Tywardreath</i>, the house on the sands; <i>Tywarnhaile</i>
(=<i>Ty war an hayle</i>), the house on the tidal river.&nbsp;
Note that the syllable <i>war</i> in these words is
unaccented.&nbsp; In <i>Trewartha</i>, the upper house, the
accent is on <i>war</i>, so that even if we were not accustomed
to the epithet <i>wartha</i> we should know that <i>war</i> is
here not a preposition.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Appositional genitive without article.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Chytan</i>, the house of fire;
<i>Chypons</i>, the bridge house; <i>Pentreath</i>, the head of
the sands; <i>Portreath</i> (=<i>Porth-treath</i>), the creek of
the sands.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Nancemelling</i> (=<i>Nans-mellan</i>),
the valley of the mill.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>5.&nbsp; Proper names as appositional
genitives:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Trejago</i>, the house of Jago (or
James).</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Chykembra</i>, the Welshman&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>G&ucirc;n-an-Guidal</i> (or <i>Anguidal
Downs</i>), the down of the Irishman.</p>
<p>In West Cornwall, especially in Penwith, where the spoken
language lingered latest, there is a greater tendency to the use
of the article <i>an</i> than in the more eastern part of the
Duchy.&nbsp; Sometimes the article is prefixed to the noun
itself.&nbsp; Thus, <i>Andrewartha</i> (=<i>an dre wartha</i>),
the upper town, in Gwithian, now called <i>Upton</i>, but
inhabited by a family of the older name; <i>Angarrack</i>, the
rock, between Hayle and Gwinear Road; <i>Angove</i>, the smith,
and <i>Angwin</i>, the white, family names; <i>Angrouse</i>, the
cross, in Mullion; <i>Angear</i>, the castle; <i>Annear</i> or
<i>Ennor</i>, the earth; <i>Angilley</i> or <i>Anguilly</i>, the
grove. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a></p>
<p>Generally when the article comes between the generic noun and
some other word the latter is a noun also, an appositional
genitive, but occasionally it is an adjective, as in
<i>Ponsanooth</i> (in Perran Arworthal and Gluvias), which is
probably <i>Pons-an-nowedh</i>, the new bridge.&nbsp; The generic
prefix <i>Pleu</i> or <i>Plou</i>, parish, so common in Brittany,
is altogether unknown in Cornish place-names of to-day, unless,
as some hold, <i>Bleu Bridge</i> in Madron means &ldquo;the
parish bridge,&rdquo; and is a partial translation of
<i>Pons-an-bleu</i>, but the word is common enough in Cornish,
and the names of parishes called after saints frequently began in
Cornish writings with <i>Pleu</i> (<i>plu</i>,
<i>plui</i>)&mdash;<i>Pleu East</i>, St. Just; <i>Pleu Paul</i>,
St. Paul; <i>Pleu Vudhick</i>, St. Budock.&nbsp; Though the word
occurs in the expression <i>t&icirc;z pleu</i>, people of [his]
parish, in the tale of <i>John of Chy-an-Hur</i>, the three
parishes mentioned there, St. Levan, St. Hillary, and Buryan, are
called by <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>their ordinary English names.&nbsp;
The prefix <i>lan</i>, originally an enclosure (cf. the English
<i>lawn</i>), but later used to signify a church with its
churchyard, is still frequently found, with occasional variants
of <i>la</i>, <i>lam</i>, and <i>land</i>, but it is nothing like
so frequent as the Welsh equivalent <i>llan</i>.&nbsp; In earlier
days it was more common in Cornwall than it is now, and a number
of parishes which now have the prefix &ldquo;Saint&rdquo; appear
in the Domesday Survey with <i>Lan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The family names of Cornwall, omitting those of the few great
Norman houses, Granvilles, Bevilles, Fortescues, Bassets, St.
Aubyns, Glanvilles, etc., which do not concern us at present,
fall into at least four classes.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Names derived from places.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By Tre, Pol, and Pen,<br />
Ye shall know Cornishmen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or as Camden more correctly expands it at the expense of
metre:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By Tre, Ros, Pol, Lan, Car, and Pen,<br />
Ye shall know the most Cornishmen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he might have added many more prefixes.&nbsp; It is
probable that many of these names originated in the possession of
the estates of the same names.</p>
<p>Of this class are such names as <i>Trelawny</i>,
<i>Rosevear</i>, <i>Polwhele</i>, <i>Lanyon</i>, <i>Carlyon</i>,
and <i>Penrose</i>.&nbsp; To the ordinary Saxon they sound highly
aristocratic, and are introduced into modern &ldquo;up
country&rdquo; novels in a way that is often amusing to a
Cornishman, and no doubt many of them do represent the names of
families of past or present gentility, for in Cornwall, as in the
Scottish Highlands, armigerous gentry were and are very thick on
the ground, and a very large number of Cornishmen of every class
and occupation <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>might write themselves down
&ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; in the strict heraldic sense if they only
knew it.&nbsp; But some names of this class are derived from very
small landed possessions, and some probably, as similar names in
England, from mere residence, not possession.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Patronymics.&nbsp; These are the equivalents of the
English names ending in <i>son</i> or <i>s</i>, of the Welsh
names beginning with <i>ap</i> (=<i>mab</i>, son), and the Irish
and Scottish beginning with <i>mac</i> or <i>O&rsquo;</i>.&nbsp;
They fall into five classes.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>a</i>.&nbsp; The Christian name used as a
surname without alteration, as <i>Harry</i>, <i>Peter</i>,
<i>John</i>, <i>Rawle</i>, <i>Rawe</i> or <i>Rowe</i> (for
<i>Ralph</i> or <i>Raoul</i>), <i>Gilbart</i> and <i>Gilbert</i>,
<i>Thomas</i> or <i>Thom</i>, <i>Davy</i>, <i>Bennet</i>,
<i>Harvey</i>, <i>Tangye</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>b</i>.&nbsp; The diminutive of the
Christian name, as <i>Jenkin</i>, <i>Hodgkin</i>, <i>Rawlin</i>,
<i>Tonkin</i>, <i>Eddyvean</i> (=Little Eddy), <i>Hockin</i>
(&mdash;<i>Hawkin</i>, i.e. <i>Harrykin</i>), etc.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>c</i>.&nbsp; The Christian name or its
diminutive in its English possessive form, as <i>Peters</i>,
<i>Johns</i>, <i>Rogers</i>, <i>Jenkins</i>, <i>Rawlings</i>,
<i>Roberts</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>d</i>.&nbsp; Patronymics formed as in
English, German, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages by adding
<i>son</i>, as <i>Johnson</i>, <i>Jackson</i>, <i>Wilson</i>,
etc.&nbsp; When these occur in Cornwall they are probably often
of English origin.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>e</i>.&nbsp; Patronymics formed with the
prefix <i>ap</i> (for <i>mab</i>, son), apocopated (as in the
Welsh names <i>Probert</i>, <i>Pritchard</i>, <i>Price</i>,
<i>Bevan</i>, <i>Bowen</i>) to a <i>p</i> or <i>b</i>.&nbsp; It
is possible that to this class may belong <i>Prowse</i>,
<i>Prawle</i> (<i>Ap Rowse</i>, <i>Ap Rawle</i>), <i>Bown</i>
(<i>Ap Owen</i>?), <i>Budge</i> (<i>Ap Hodge</i>?),
<i>Pezzack</i> (<i>Ap Isaac</i>).</p>
<p>The Christian names from which patronymics are formed are not
as a rule very peculiar.&nbsp; There are the usual names of the
well-known saints, <i>Peter</i>, <i>Paul</i>, <i>Mitchell</i>
(<i>Michael</i>), <i>John</i>, <i>James</i> (or in its Cornish
form, <i>Jago</i>), <i>Thomas</i>, <i>Matthew</i>,
<i>Francis</i>, <i>Dunstan</i>, <i>Bennet</i>, <i>Andrew</i>,
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span><i>Martin</i>, and the rest, the common general
Christian names, <i>Harry</i>, <i>William</i>, <i>Robert</i>,
<i>Roger</i>, etc., and some less common ones, such as
<i>Julyan</i>, <i>Vivian</i>, <i>Nicholas</i> (<i>Nicol</i>,
<i>Nicholl</i>, etc.), <i>Colin</i>, <i>Jeffry</i>,
<i>Jasper</i>, <i>Gilbert</i>, etc., and names of Cornish saints,
<i>Keverne</i>, <i>Key</i>, <i>Gluyas</i>, <i>Ustick</i>
(probably adjectival form from <i>Just</i>).&nbsp; Besides these
there are a few from old British, or of Breton or Norman
introduction, <i>Harvey</i> (<i>Herv&eacute;</i>), <i>Dennis</i>,
<i>Rawle</i>, <i>and Rawlin</i> (<i>Raoul</i>, <i>Raoulin</i>,
<i>Rivallen</i>), <i>Tangye</i> (<i>Tanguy</i>, a quite common
name in Brittany, from St. Tanguy, one of the entourage of St.
Pol of Leon), <i>Arthur</i>, <i>David</i> or <i>Davy</i> (as
representing the Welsh saint, not the King of Israel),
<i>Sampson</i> (representing the Bishop of Dol, not the Israelite
hero), <i>Jewell</i> (Breton <i>Judicael</i> or
<i>Juhel</i>).&nbsp; Some names take a variety of forms.&nbsp;
Thus <i>Clement</i> is found as <i>Clemens</i>, <i>Clemments</i>,
<i>Clements</i>, <i>Clemo</i> or <i>Clemmow</i>, <i>Climo</i>,
<i>Climance</i>, etc., <i>Ralph</i> (<i>Radulphus</i>,
<i>Rudolph</i>, <i>Randolph</i>, <i>Rollo</i>) is found as
<i>Ralph</i>, <i>Rapson</i>, <i>Rawe</i>, <i>Rawle</i>,
<i>Rawlin</i>, <i>Rawling</i>, <i>Rawlings</i>, <i>Rabling</i>,
<i>Randall</i>, <i>Rowe</i>, <i>Rowling</i>, <i>Rowse</i>,
etc.&nbsp; There are also certain names which have a resemblance
to Spanish names, <i>Pascoe</i>, <i>Varcoe</i>, <i>Jago</i>,
<i>Crago</i>, <i>Manuel</i>, etc., but no theory of Spanish
influence is necessarily to be built upon them, as they are
otherwise explainable.&nbsp; As the Cornish had got beyond the
matriarchal stage of culture before historic times, we do not
find family names derived from names of women, but no chapter on
Cornish nomenclature can omit that very remarkable and peculiarly
Cornish name <i>Jennifer</i>, which is beyond any doubt a local
form of the name of Guenivere, the wife of Arthur.&nbsp; A more
Frenchified form is still found in Brittany, and the Cornish form
goes back to time immemorial.&nbsp; At one time the name of an
equally celebrated Queen of Cornwall was used as a Cornish
Christian name, for <i>Ysolt</i> de Cardinham possessed the
advowson of the church of Colan in <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the
thirteenth century, but except as a modern revival, of which the
present writer knows only one case connected with Cornwall, this
name is no longer found.&nbsp; Another not infrequent Christian
name is <i>Hannibal</i>, from which possibly may come the
surnames <i>Hambly</i>, <i>Hamley</i>, and <i>Hamblyn</i>.&nbsp;
The name is too old in Cornwall to have originated in any theory
about the Ph&oelig;nicians and the tin trade of the Cassiterides,
for it is found in times when no one troubled himself about
either, but its origin is decidedly a puzzle.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Names derived from trades or occupations.&nbsp; Some
of these are only English, <i>Smith</i>, <i>Wright</i>,
<i>Carpenter</i>, <i>Brewer</i>, <i>Paynter</i>, etc., but others
are real Cornish, as <i>Marrack</i>, knight; <i>Angove</i>, the
smith; <i>Drew</i>, druid, magician (and perhaps <i>An-drew</i>,
the druid, when it is not merely a patronymic); <i>Tyacke</i>,
farmer; <i>Sayer</i> and <i>Sara</i>, possibly <i>Saer</i>,
carpenter; <i>Hellyar</i>, hunter; <i>Cauntor</i> (Lat.
<i>Cantor</i>), singer.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Nicknames or names derived from personal
peculiarities, such as <i>Black</i>, <i>White</i>, <i>Brown</i>,
<i>Grey</i>, <i>Green</i>, which are mostly found in English,
though one finds <i>Angwin</i>, the white, and <i>Winn</i>,
white; <i>Glass</i> and <i>Glaze</i>, blue; <i>Couch</i>, red;
<i>Floyd</i> (cf. Welsh <i>Lloyd</i>), grey; <i>Glubb</i>, moist,
wet; <i>Coath</i>, <i>Coad</i>, and its English <i>Olde</i> or
<i>Ould</i>; <i>Baragwaneth</i>, wheat-bread, etc.&nbsp; Also
names derived from names of animals, <i>Bullock</i>, <i>Cock</i>,
<i>Fox</i>, or its Cornish <i>Lewarne</i> (unless that is
<i>Le-warne</i>, the place of alders), <i>Mutton</i> (though this
may be a place-name also), etc.&nbsp; One does not see why a man
should have been called <i>Curnow</i>, the Cornishman, in a
country in which such an epithet could not have been very
distinguishing, but that name is not at all uncommon, nor is
<i>Andain</i> or <i>Endean</i>, the man, which is still less
distinguishing.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>This is only a slight sketch of a considerable range of
investigation, but the subject would require a book to itself, so
that it is impossible here to do more than indicate the direction
in which students of Cornish nomenclature should work.&nbsp; But
in the investigation of place-names in any language one must
always allow for corruption and alteration in the course of
centuries, and in a Celtic country for the Celticising of names
of non-Celtic derivation.&nbsp; Thus the well-known Welsh name
<i>Bettws</i> is probably the old English bede-house
(prayer-house), <i>Gattws</i>, less common, is gatehouse.&nbsp;
The terminations <i>aig</i>, <i>sgor</i>, <i>bhal</i>,
<i>dail</i>, <i>ort</i>, so common in the Hebrides and West
Highlands, are Gaelic forms of the Norse <i>vik</i>,
<i>skj&oelig;r</i>, <i>val</i>, <i>dal</i>, <i>fjord</i>, and
many names in those parts are altogether Norse, spelt Gaelic
fashion, and have no meaning whatever in Gaelic.&nbsp; Probably
the Cornish place-name <i>Bereppa</i>, <i>Barrepper</i>,
<i>Brepper</i>, <i>Borripper</i>, of which instances occur in
Gunwalloe, Penponds, Mawnan, and elsewhere, is only the French
<i>Beau-Repaire</i>, and there are probably many other names of
French derivation.&nbsp; Dr. Bannister&rsquo;s Glossary of
Cornish Names is of so eminently uncritical a character as to be
of little use.&nbsp; Though he had a wide knowledge of separate
Cornish words, he was no philologist, and did not seem to
understand how to put his words together.&nbsp; Had he only given
the situation of the places&mdash;the name of the parish would
have been something towards it&mdash;he would have left a basis
for future work.&nbsp; As it is, the whole work needs to be done
over again.&nbsp; Of course one need hardly say that out of such
a large collection of names a considerable number of the
derivations are quite correctly stated, but those are mostly the
easy and obvious ones, and even easy ones are often wrong, and it
was quite useless to encumber the glossary with the hopeless
derivations of eighteenth-century <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>writers.&nbsp; But the interpretation of place-names is
not so simple as it looks, and it is easier to criticise other
people&rsquo;s derivations than to find better ones, so that one
may admire Dr. Bannister&rsquo;s industry while one deprecates
the recklessness of many of his conclusions.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, like the Welsh and Bretons as well as
the Latin nations, the Cornish derived the names of the days
directly from Latin, and did not, like the Teutonic nations,
translate them in accordance with primitive ideas of comparative
mythology.</p>

speak of Brittany as &ldquo;notre petite patrie,&rdquo; and
France as &ldquo;notre grande patrie,&rdquo; and none have fought
and died for France more bravely than these.&nbsp; As soldiers
(and still more as sailors) they are to France what the
Highlanders are to Britain, and avenge the atrocities of 1793 in
the same noble fashion as that in which the Gaels have avenged
the horrors of Culloden and its sequel.&nbsp; Loyalty is in the

<p><a name="footnote54"></a><a href="#citation54"
class="footnote">[54]</a>&nbsp; In compound words the accent is
always on the qualifying part, and if that is a monosyllable and
comes last, the accent is therefore on the last syllable.&nbsp;
This is common in place-names.</p>
<p><a name="footnote55"></a><a href="#citation55"
class="footnote">[55]</a>&nbsp; It seems likely that in the very
peculiar intonation of Zennor, Morvah, Towednack, and the country
part of St. Ives the true intonation of Cornish may be best
preserved.&nbsp; But this is mere conjecture.</p>
<p><a name="footnote56"></a><a href="#citation56"
class="footnote">[56]</a>&nbsp; The modern Cornish pronunciation
of the word &ldquo;trade,&rdquo; in its local and rather
contemptuous sense of &ldquo;ropes&rsquo; ends, dead mice, and
other combustibles&rdquo; (as Cornishman once denned it), shows
the sound of this vowel fairly well.</p>
<p><a name="footnote57"></a><a href="#citation57"
class="footnote">[57]</a>&nbsp; Care must be taken in this case
to avoid that <i>&#375;</i> sound given to the English <i>a</i>
in London twang (<i>e.g.</i> l&#563;dy for lady).</p>
<p><a name="footnote59a"></a><a href="#citation59a"
class="footnote">[59a]</a>&nbsp; The combination <i>ao</i> in
Irish is pronounced <i>t</i>.&nbsp; Thus <i>caol</i>, narrow, is
<i>cul</i> in the Highlands and <i>k&icirc;l</i> in Ireland.</p>
<p><a name="footnote59b"></a><a href="#citation59b"
class="footnote">[59b]</a>&nbsp; The word <i>bewnans</i>, life,
formed from the root <i>bew</i>, was often written <i>bownans</i>
in late Cornish and probably pronounced <i>boonans</i>.&nbsp;
Similarly <i>bowjy</i> (=<i>bewgh-ch&#375;</i>), cow-house, must
have been <i>bewjy</i>.&nbsp; This last, which is one of the
surviving Cornish words, has its <i>ow</i> at present sounded as
in <i>now</i>.&nbsp; This change has happened not infrequently in
place-names.</p>
<p><a name="footnote63"></a><a href="#citation63"
class="footnote">[63]</a>&nbsp; The word <i>en</i>, in, in quite
late Cornish, was apparently sounded <i>et</i>, which is a
solitary case of the disappearance of <i>n</i> in a
monosyllable.</p>

<p><a name="footnote65"></a><a href="#citation65"
class="footnote">[65]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Whitley Stokes, in a paper of
additions to Williams&rsquo;s Cornish Lexicon (Philol. Soc.
1868), gives it as his opinion that the <i>th</i> of the MSS.
should not be written <i>dh</i> at the <i>end</i> of a word, and
that Williams, in doing so, was wrongly following Welsh
analogy.&nbsp; But there is an evident tendency in <i>late</i>
Cornish to end words in <i>z</i> for <i>s</i>, <i>v</i> for
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i> for <i>k</i>, and a considerable number of
words which Williams ends in <i>dh</i> end in the corresponding z

this matter, though there is a good deal to be said both
ways.</p>

<p><a name="footnote78"></a><a href="#citation78"
class="footnote">[78]</a>&nbsp; The change of initial of the
masculine plural is by no means universal in the MSS., but it is
not infrequent, and is the rule in Breton (with a few
exceptions), so it seems fair to conjecture that it was the
Cornish rule also.</p>
<p><a name="footnote80"></a><a href="#citation80"
class="footnote">[80]</a>&nbsp; Note how a masculine ending in
<i>a</i> affects the initial of the adjective as if it were a
feminine.</p>
<p><a name="footnote81"></a><a href="#citation81"
class="footnote">[81]</a>&nbsp; It sometimes happens (as Dr.
Stokes points out) that if the first noun is feminine, the noun
in the genitive has its initial in the second state, in fact it
is treated as an adjective qualifying the preceding noun, e.g.
<i>bennath Varya</i>, the blessing of Mary; <i>carek
Veryasek</i>, the rock of Meriasek; <i>fynten woys</i>, a well of
blood, but as this also happens at times when the first noun is
masculine (e.g. <i>cledha dan</i>, Cr. 964), it probably only
means that mutations were rather loosely used.&nbsp; The last two
are &ldquo;genitives of material.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote86"></a><a href="#citation86"
class="footnote">[86]</a>&nbsp; Note that when a syllable is
added to a word ending in <i>gh</i>, the <i>g</i> is omitted.</p>
<p><a name="footnote94"></a><a href="#citation94"
class="footnote">[94]</a>&nbsp; <i>Idn</i>, to qualify a noun;
<i>omen</i>, used by itself.&nbsp; Thus, <i>idn d&ecirc;n</i>,
one man; <i>&#334;nen hag Ol</i>, One and All.&nbsp;
<i>W&#466;nnen</i> is an alternative form of the latter.</p>
<p><a name="footnote96"></a><a href="#citation96"
class="footnote">[96]</a>&nbsp; It has been held that this
apparent singular, which is used after numerals in Welsh and
Breton also, is really a genitive plural.&nbsp; In the Gaelic
languages, in which the case-inflections of nouns still exist,
the genitive plural is usually (though not universally) the same
as the nominative singular, except in Manx, where it is only
distinguishable from the nominative plural by its article, but
except in the cases of <i>da</i>, two, <i>fichead</i>, twenty,
<i>ceud</i>, a hundred, and <i>mile</i>, a thousand, which
precede nouns in the singular, the plural follows numerals in
those languages.</p>
<p><a name="footnote119"></a><a href="#citation119"
class="footnote">[119]</a>&nbsp; There is, however, some blight
confusion in late Cornish MSS. between this use of <i>re</i>, and
the auxiliary form with <i>wr&icirc;g</i>.&nbsp; The difference
of sound in cases of verbs beginning with <i>g</i> or <i>c</i>
would be very slight.</p>

different forms of this tense apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to

<i>Creation</i>, 1. 599, &ldquo;<i>Myhall sera thewgh

and to translate it &ldquo;Michael! sir, grammercy to
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Compare the English use of &ldquo;Marry!&rdquo;
(for Mary!) or &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; (for God!) without <i>by</i>
before them.&nbsp; It is written all in one word and spelt the
same as the name of St. Michael in the same play.&nbsp; It is no
more of an anachronism to make Eve swear by St. Michael than (in
<i>Res. Dom.</i>, 1387) to make St. Thomas swear by St. Mary.</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
